0,0,Microsoft,Outlook accounts created for children are unrecoverable if you forget the password,"I've been trying to find a resolution to a problem of how to recover my young child's Outlook account which they use exclusively for Minecraft, because we don't remember the password. 

As currently designed, Outlook account setup for children leaves you with an account that has no recovery information set. If your child isn't using the account for an XBox console, Skype, or sending emails, there is simply no way to recover the account if you forget your password.

Here is the process I went through to set up an Outlook account for a child (I just did this again recently):

1. Pick username and password
2. Enter first and last name
3. Enter birth date
4. Are you the parent/guardian? If yes, sign in to grant consent.
5. ""_____’s Microsoft account has been created!
They can use their account with all Microsoft products, websites, online services, and apps.""
6. After granting consent, the process is done. When the process is over, you are logged into your own account in Family Safety settings, not the child's account.

So the only information collected in the account creation for a child is the child's first and last name, their birth date, and the adult's authorization to create the account. And that isn't enough to recover the account with the existing account recovery form. Even if you are controlling settings for the child's account under Family Safety, there is no way to recover it if you forget the password. It's kind of crazy that I was asked to go through the process of setting up Family Safety, but not asked to set up recovery info.

To actually get recovery info set up for the new child's account I just created, I had to log out of my account (where it was left at the end of the account creation process), log into my child's account, got to My Account -> Security -> Manage How I Sign In, and then add alternate email / phone number. Nothing prompted me to do this, I had to figure it out. Your average parent who is just trying to get their kid set up to play Minecraft is not going to figure this out without prompting.

One of two things needs to happen to prevent bad user experiences like this. Either the account setup process for children should ask for recovery information, or the account recovery form should ask for things like Family Safety information. Preferably both of these could be done!

I hope somebody at Microsoft who can help to address this problem, because it has left me very frustrated. How sad is it for a kid to lose their game progress because of stuff like this? At some point, I'm going to have to tell my child, ""sorry, we're going to need to get a new account for you because we don't remember your password and there's no way to get your account back."" I can see his account in Family Sharing, I could in theory control screen time and stuff like that. But there's no way to reset his password.

This is a common problem that affects a lot of people. Here is just a very small sample of people with the same problem:

I chatted with someone at the Microsoft ""help"" desk who said the account was suspended and that they have this issue all the time and that they are working on it. They said try again within 24 hours and if not wait 7 days and maybe it will be fixed.

For whatever reason that I cannot track down, when an event is shared from one calendar to another, the event will post and then suddenly disappear. I have verified calendar permissions, delegates and e-mail rules. I even completely rebuilt the rooms with new addresses and everything, but the problem persists. 

There have been several ""temporary"" solutions where the issue was resolved, but then promptly returned minutes later...

Message Trace - Partial resolution. I was able to identify an old user that had delegate access to another user's inbox that had rules auto declining the event. 

Location - When selecting the event location, the user must add the location by typing the name. The user cannot add through the address book without the issue appearing again. 

Full Access Delegation/User Cache Mode - Partial resolution. When I removed all but one delegate to hopefully bypass mailbox rules of unknown delegates, that particular delegates calendar was suddenly split in two. Permissions became inaccessible and the number of synced events dropped to less than half of the original. I turned off Cache Mode and the calendars corrected themselves to show the proper permissions. But the main issue still persists.

As far as I can tell, there may still be a rule buried in a delegate who has access to another users inbox. But I am only able to drill down so far.

Years later yet the most basic feature of accessibility configuration option is still not available, besides teams major update not so long ago.

Of course is not that common for apps in general to enable you to change the notification sounds, it is pretty specific, but microsoft needs to keep in mind that this is not a conventional app, it's sole purpose is work related stuff, of course you wouldn't be able to change notification sounds on a gaming platform because is not that important, but being 9/5 hearing the same hammer on the head notification sound changes your mood completely.

I was reading every response and it is literally causing PTSD on people.

The power of associativity is pretty heavy on this one, I would love to be able to have AT LEAST 3-4 other alternatives, how hard would be to have a simple drop-down list that just switch an audio file, how hard coded could that be for microsoft to not even consider the possibility? where are the engineers that work on accesibility?

This is a serious problem, you're playing with a subconscious part of the brain that only hear the same notification sound over and over, and in fact the moments where you hear this on repeat is mainly on problematic situations, so yeah, pretty heavy on the associativity, the brain pick subliminal clues on the environment, even a simple thing as smell is enough for you to face a situation on a certain way or not, sound clues aren't low on that scale.

Simple suggestion:

1. Being able to switch notification sounds individually/themes, you won't even need to be able to upload your own, just get other 4 themes, and that is enough.

I wouldn't suggest anything more if they cannot manage to add one of the most basic functionality, yet I'm not able to avoid the mass cluster of services that are overkill for the most simple tasks inside teams, looks like modern journalist websites, trying to convice teams users of problems that they don't have, but if you manage to convince greedy people of doing their work, then you can also introduce the possibility of switching a notification sound for an specific group besides the ""global"" default.

It doesn't look like they care about their users nor read any of the suggestions, this was clearly not new, it's not that hard, and it solve 80% of the problem.",1717164583.0,NEGATIVE,0.9988335967063904

I will try to be as explicit as possible, I want to develop applications for PC, and in one of those ideas I want to develop anti-virus software that is friendly with Microsoft Defender, since I am starting, I would like to create something that meets these requirements:

Have an interface (Like any program), with its scan button and its respective animations.

NOT to be in real time, I don't want Windows Defender to detect it as a virus

That it has an option to analyze connections that are connected at that moment, make a list and give you the name of a web page so that you can insert one of those IPs to see if it has a non-legitimate remote connection.

Now... Where do I start, what should I learn, what knowledge should I have, is there a tutorial on how to develop simple antiviruses (As a start, then we improve), how I create an interface and how to use visual studio code.

At the moment I only have the idea, please guys help me, I need to make the idea a reality and then improve it",1717029732.0,NEGATIVE,0.757710874080658

When I received my laptop, Microsoft 365 Personal was included. This, also included 1 TB of OneDrive along with other benefits of 365. Be aware that by this time, my Microsoft account was brand new so I never had any passwords or products bought on the account.

I upgraded to Windows 11, which came with a problem. I could no longer access my Microsoft account. Why? Because Microsoft thinks my account has ""unusual activity"" or ""believe my credentials are at risk (I had no credentials yet). It also asks me to verify my identity and change my password.

The worst part? I practically can't. Though I must admit it was my fault because I never put in a recovery email nor did I put the country code NOR the plus sign in the recovery phone number. 

If you try to recover your account without using a phone number or email address, it'll bring you to the recovery page for accounts where you have to answer a bunch of questions about your email. However, since I had practically nothing to answer because my account was completely fresh, Microsoft will deny it without even reading the answers.

Is there ANYWAY I can get my account back without losing 365? I practically have limited time to get it back because I have to activate 365 in less than 6 months of Windows activation.

131,131,Microsoft,GoDaddy E-Mail & Outlook 365,"Greetings...

I'm going to try to make this as simple as possible because apparently I'm not getting through GoDaddy's heads in getting them to understand.  Situation is this:

I have a domain that I own (sgrignoli.net) which is registered through GoDaddy. As part of that, they are my e-mail host.  For years and years, I was able to retrieve my e-mails into my laptop applications (i.e. Mail on my MacBook; Outlook; Eudora; et cetera) by way of configuring their POP info.  However, about a year or so, they did away with that and went the Office 365 route.  They forced me to subscribe to THEIR Microsoft 365 Mail setup.

* |**Microsoft 365 Email Essentials Basic** Renewal|1 User|1 Year|$38.28|

This was even though I had ALREADY subscribed to the entire Microsoft Office 365 package on my own (to use Word; Excel; Office; et cetera).

* Subscription: **Microsoft 365 Personal**
* Plan Price: USD 69.99 plus applicable taxes/1 year

I didn't like the fact that I had to pay for GoDaddy's Outlook, but it was no big deal.  Over the past year of so, I was able to retrieve my e-mails into my Outlook 365 in my MacBook Pro with no issues.

However.....

I have now upgraded my Mid-2014 MacBook to a newer model (Nov-2023), and I had installed my Microsoft Office 365 onto this new Mac.  But, when I try to configured Outlook to do out and pull in my e-mails, it is telling me that I have no license to do so.  I do the following:

At the Welcome to Outlook pop-up, it asks me to enter my e-mail address, which I do...(the same address that is registered with GoDaddy) (XXX.XXX@sgrignoli.net).  It thens tries to go out there, and I receive this:  ""This account cannot be added.  The license provided by your work or school does not enable access to Outlook for Mac.  Please access your e-mail through Outlook on the web instead.""

First off, as far as I know, I'm using a ""Personal"" version - not a school/work version - regardless of my subscription.  As you can see above, I have the Microsoft 365 Personal version that I subscribe to directly.   But, GoDaddy does not explicitly use that term, except to say ""Microsoft 365 Email Essentials Basic"".  So, not quite sure where it is picking-up that school/work is even involved.

Like I said, I'm trying to configure the Office 365 on my NEW Mac to pull in mail into Outlook just like it does ""fine"" on my older Mac.  Any thoughts on what I may be missing or doing wrong?

After that, I worked on multiple startups like a book subscription box, fashion e-commerce brand, grocery delivery, and marketing agency. I also did freelance copywriting for SaaS. Some of them worked; some didn't.

I have also done three jobs in customer success and textile & apparel consultancy.

When I started my SaaS product 1.5 years ago, which was a solution to a problem I faced firsthand, I really thought it would be a breakthrough for my career. I invested all the money, time, and energy I could. To give you some more context, I am from a non-tech background, and building this product was not just a side gig. I left my full-time job and accepted a part-time job at a fraction of the salary I could earn as I wanted to fund my startup as well.

No regrets there, I learned so much and when I look back I am glad I took the decision to start this company. My personality and network really grew and I was able to attract ambitious people in my life.

But now the market has changed, and after researching extensively, I decided to shut it down as the risk-to-result ratio turned out to be really bad. After thinking a lot, I have decided to take a break from entrepreneurship (which is very hard) and get a full-time job at companies like Microsoft, Meta, or Apple.

I could never sign into my Microsoft account because it would either pop up to login when I was using Word or Excel as a blank page, or I would type in my email and it would never advance to the password. So I deleted my subscription and have been living without a cloud since January. 

I bought Minecraft the other day for my PC because it's on sale. I went through my email to see my purchase, signed into my Microsoft account on the web to download the game, then was told I have to download the game through the Xbox app on my computer. THE DAMN MICROSOFT LOGIN IS BLANK. Therefore, this is an issue that has plagued my entire computer and all applications. I know that my account is not corrupt because I can access it perfectly fine on the internet. 

Since this is a school issued laptop, completely restarting it will result in me taking a trip to the not so helpful help-desk for IT and let me tell you, I've already hard reset before when I was dealing with the Onedrive/Word login issue back in January. It did not solve the problem and only created more because I had to go have the IT kids download all the university shit again.

Here's the story: Two months ago, I got a call from Microsoft HR expressing their interest in me. I eagerly agreed to an interview, which was scheduled within a week (a screening with the hiring manager). After the screening, I tried to follow up with the recruiter, but no response. I noticed his LinkedIn profile had an 'Open to work' badge. It hit me that he might not be with Microsoft anymore hence I my chances are gone.

Fast forward a month, and I received an email from another recruiter inviting me to continue the process. I was thrilled and completed all four tech rounds, including another chat with the hiring manager. I mentioned the HR issue to her, and she was super apologetic, sharing her email in case I had any more problems.

But guess what? After my interviews, silence again. I decided to email my hiring manager directly after a week. She responded right away, apologizing and tagging the new recruiter to get in touch with me. The recruiter replied, promising to get back to me that same day.

It's now been three days, and despite sending a reminder (without cc'ing the hiring manager), there's still no response.

296,296,Microsoft,Things Our Operating System Does Not Need:,"Dear Microsoft Executives,

I have been using Windows since Windows 3.0. I have installed and used just about every edition of Windows that has ever existed, and I have defended it in the face of naysayers for decades.  However, you are following a worrying path with your OS and have been for quite some time, and I am extremely disappointed. My voice is but one voice, *but I am sure that I am not alone.*

We (myself and those who think like me) do not want nor need the following things in Windows; they do not make our experience easier nor do they make it safer or better in any way:

1. We do not want nor need Windows to spy on us, collect our telemetry and user data, and exploit it either internally or by selling it to other companies.
2. We do not want nor need Windows to advertise to us anywhere in the OS.
3. We do not want nor need Windows to decide for us what the ""best"" or ""safest"" default apps are.
4. We do not want nor need Windows to have ""AI"" built-in.  See #1 for more information.
5. We do not want nor need Windows to run ""on the cloud"" as opposed to on our local hardware.

These just scratch the surface.  All of these things should be **OPT-IN,** only installed and/or used if you consent to them.  They should not be forced on us or OPT-OUT with hidden or obfuscated ways to do so.

AI is particularly egregious because the concept of having an AI assistant in our computers is one that many of us have dreamed about for DECADES. However, corporate America can't let it just be an optional component and can't let it be 100% local and private; they HAVE to be able to monetize the data it collects.

I worry for the future of technology of all breeds; will prosthetics and implants sell our usage data and force subscription fees and ads on us? Our cars already are allowed to prevent us from using features **already installed** unless we pay extra money.. corporations don't want us to own anything or have any rights whatsoever with the products and services we pay for. This dystopia is in many ways worse than the cyberpunk dystopias we grew up reading about.

Anyway, I know no one important will read this and it will just collect ephemeral dust on reddit servers, but it is important. I hope many more people will read this and add to this list, and that it somehow makes it to someone who needs to see it.

Thank you for your time,

My husband is starting a small business with the CNC and is hesitant to upgrade his Surface, but I want to buy him one as a present. 

I saw the new models announced yesterday and I’m looking for guidance:
- is this even the right machine for his needs?
- if so, should I buy the laptop or tablet?
- Are there any upgrades I should consider? (Eg storage space, pencil, etc)
- What else should I consider?

And then Microsoft releases “Copilot+ PCs” with Snapdragon that actually can do on device AI inference/image gen. Why not just have this be the AI PC in the first place??

By spam I mean the kind of emails with malicious links.

So I have 0 emails in the junk folder in outlook email but I haven't really used this account for email much. Once I start out give out its email address to accounts and maybe this number I'm guessing would go up.

TLDR: Is Outlook email's spam filter just as good as Gmail or better? Because I want to make the switch to outlook email.

368,368,Microsoft,Rant Microsoft does not allow a user to separate different activities by different accounts,"To separate my gaming activities from other activities, I am simply using two different Microsoft accounts. However, meanwhile, Microsoft does no longer allow to use a different Account for the XBox App (which is annoying bullshit, anyway) and the normal Microsoft store. This means, that I always have to re-log again and again. Even if I were willing to cease that separation, I would have to transfer software licenses (e.g. Minecraft) from one account to another, which is not possible. What Microsoft created here, is not only annoying, it is a big mess, it is de facto hindering the user from using the software licenses he has payed for (in case of minecraft long before the software belonged to microsoft). I do and not will not abuse software licenses in a way that it is used on more than one computer. But once I have bought a software license, I must be able to use it without interference with other so called ""services"", which are nothing more than annoying, spying, providing bullshit, I did not ask for and I do not want, but am anyway urged to use.

To me, microsoft is behaving more and more in an unethical way. Making business, the strong will to earn money is OK, as long as it is not forgotten that at a certain point the term ""enough"" must be applied. However, what microsoft does, is the attempt to monitor and control me and my private life, which is not acceptable. It is, as if you buy a car and have the manufacture monitoring and controlling where you drive and how you drive. Shame on you, Microsoft!

I'd love to hear from you what are tangible thing you apply in your role \*if you are a PM) or things you appreciate a PM does.

In the spirit of sharing, here are some things that helped me and I learned transitioning from a UX designer to a PM (some much needed lessons learned):

* Keep documentation in email chains. Including requests for action items.
* Every person is motivated by something different, have a mental log and used methods like Operating Manuals or Disc Assessments while asking people about their goals.
* When meeting with designers and posing a question on direction, ask everyone else first what their thoughts on a preference is before jumping in with your own thoughts once in a while. It shows you trust their opinion and they can share their reasoning, and if you really disagree you can work to convince them otherwise instead of dictating.
* Never assume someones messing up without asking first, it could literally be a file having an issue updating or something small and you don't want to look like a shmuk. It's such an ich of mine when people jump to conclusions first.
* Keep in the back of your mind 'backups' for people (including yourself, a deputy PM if you need to go out that can be replaced with an existing person on the team) and train those people up or put them in a position where they're very aware of another persons work if need be.
* Have important links always referenced and don't use repeating file names or duplicates of folders
* If possible for challenging coversations have a buffer on the call so an 'objective' (no one is really objective but nonetheless) person can be there.
* Find your leadership style. I'm an entertainer and that's naturally bring people on board with charisma. I'm definitely not a strong developer, but I make sure to act in a way that fosters good connections on the team and brings up moral, while trusting people in their roles.
* Ask people about when they can have something done by instead of dictating, or if you have to dictate, ask them if they can get it done by a certain date instead of telling them.
* Vocal intonation that sounds collaborative and strong verbal delivery > a lot of other soft skills",1716053664.0,NEGATIVE,0.9460952877998352
392,392,Microsoft,My love-hate relationship with Microsoft,"I like Windows OS for daily usage, gaming etc. but I somehow also hate it. I have a similar relationship with other Microsoft products.

I hate it that Windows tries to shove down things down my throat. Such as their new Outlook app. I was quite happy with the simple and fast ""Mail"" app but Windows won't let me use it in peace.

Last week an emergency happened with my HP server and I had to install a special software to my brand new Windows PC to rescue the server. You'd expect the software to appear on your start menu when you type ""HP"" right? Surely not! Windows start menu is filled to the brim with all kinds of stupid web results, offers and whatnot but there's not a sign of the HP sofware you installed seconds ago.

Trying to install Windows, I say no to Office 365. Microsoft insists, ARE YOU SURE?... I AM FKING SURE, Microsoft! And nowadays, I started to see random popups appear out of the blue, offering me great Microsoft software. Surely they are great, all popups always offer great things.

And their spam filter seems to be engineered to do the exact opposite of what a spam filter is supposed to do. When I expect to receive an important e-mail, I check my spam folder first, because 99% of the time that's where I'll find it.

World-known, famous company sent you an e-mail? Microsoft will definitely treat it as spam. But half the spam will find their ways right into your mailbox. The amount of stupidity that has been engineered into Microsoft Outlook simply amazes me.

These are just from the top of my head. I can come up with more astonishingly stupid shit specifically designed  by Microsoft to get on my nerves.

How could MS Authenticator see this even? And are these somehow being stored on an MS server somewhere. 

I turned off Sync with my Hotmail account and the passwords are gone. So that's good. But I'm confused about how they were there in the first place, are they also saved with Microsoft somewhere. Very confused about this.  Appreciate any help anyone can provide. ",1715961716.0,NEGATIVE,0.9713706374168396

425,425,Microsoft,Edge's Co-Pilot AI is Amazing! Here is an example I was extremely impressed about. ,"Any question I ask it gets answers from various sites and compiles them to make the best answer. The best example I can give to show its power is when I ask it very specific questions related to gaming, For ex. I'm playing Bioshock Infinite right now. I'm a trophy seeker so I'm trying to get platinum trophy. I'm working on the voxophone collectible trophy. I wanted to know if it was possible to go back and get any that I missed and still be able to pop the trophy without playing the whole game again. So in edge I typed ""Can I go back and get voxophones I missed in Bioshock Infinite""  

The following is what it gave me as an answer. 



Certainly! If you’ve missed Voxophones in *BioShock Infinite*, here’s how you can find them:

1. **Use a Guide**: Check a collectible/Voxophone guide, such as the one on GameFAQs. It lists the names and locations of each Voxophone.
2. **Check Your Voxophone List**: Load your most recent save and review your Voxophone list. Cross off the ones you already have. Note the missing ones.
3. **Revisit Specific Chapters**: Go to the chapters where you missed Voxophones. Make sure to pass an auto-save point before quitting back to the main menu[^(1)](https://gaming.stackexchange.com/questions/119062/how-can-i-tell-when-ive-missed-a-voxophone).

Remember, you can exit to the main menu, select the chapter with the missing Voxophones, collect them, and then continue playing from your furthest progression[^(2)](https://www.xboxachievements.com/forum/topic/416133-ive-missed-one-voxophone-and-im-about-to-finish-the-game/). Happy hunting! 🎧🔍

  
\*\*\*\*\*\*\*COOLEST THING ABOUT IT: Each of those steps were not listed together on any one site, it searched all the answers from various sites in order to compile a list of steps to easily follow. and at the end included hyperlinks to the various sites it compiled from. now that is so cool imo!! AI took a giant leap as far as being readily avail to anyone to use. esp in a browser. I'm impressed. what do you all think? ",1715909379.0,POSITIVE,0.9998621940612793

We are experiencing a strange behaviour with USB headsets with Teams on Horizon View.

* O3365 + New Teams is installed on the gold image with XML file (shared computer mode)
* Instant clone pool
* Windows 11 Pro
* Horizon 8 (2312)
* The user connects to his virtual desktop session by using the windows horizon client (last version) with Blast protocol (tested with PCOIP also)
* There are no specific USB headset drivers for the tested devices
* USB redirection on horizon agent active
* Audio/video redirecction on horizon agent active
* No DEM agent, no FSLogix agent installed

Here is the behaviour:

1. The user physicaly plugs the headset USB on his local PC 

2. Then the USB headset is activated on the horizon client usb options 

3. The USB headset is added to the audio devices on the VDI desktop

4. The user can use the headset on any windows application (youtube, IP Phone, etc) on the VDI session, with exception of Microsoft Teams (the audio devices doesnt appears on the Teans audio devices list)

5. If the user deactivates the headset usb from the horizon client menu option (thus it is redirected to the local computer), then the devices suddenly appears on the VDI Teams session. But also it is detected at the local computer at the same time.

Any ideas about how to fix that??

Nothing came to mail about logging in, although I had logging attempts for past couple of days, I think I downloaded some malware.

I needed to download some adobe programs for my uni, since I don't have that much money to be paying subscription every month for couple of years I tried to download cracked one. I've downloaded photoshop and illustrator 2 years ago and it went without a problem. I tried to download premiere 4 days ago, and my computer just went crazy my windows security and all sort of stuff, said it is some trojan coinminer, I watched every single way on youtube how to get rid of it, went to the safe mode full scanned it tens of times and I thought I got rid of it because it said nothing was found. So basically tommorow somebody got into my instagram account that was logged on my pc from Indonesia and followed random pages. I was like how did he got into without me getting any sort of email of warning or something? Next thing he tried is Facebook but because I had a bunch of stuff turned on it was just a try and I changed my password. Today he got into my telegram account that was also on my pc logged, so I think that's what connects them all, I got my account but he's singed in and I can't get him terminated because he's logged longer than me?!?!? But okay he tried some other sites I got emails for that. BUT the plot twist of it all I went on my microsoft account and saw 5 or 6 login tries even before I downloaded premiere, like 2 days, and that whole week I wasn't even on my laptop that much I was just watching youtube and that's basically it. So I'm really scared because this is lasting for a couple of days now and I geniunely think It's just a matter of time before he get's into something big and literally fuck my life up. I lost my apetite, can't sleep, can't function like at all. I'm thinking about factory resetting windows, but I also think cookies are the problem because I'm just paranoic, should I delete cookies first, factory reset windows and then change passwords or in what order?

We are planing to use FSlogix with an Horizon view farm.

We have tested it with shared config folders and it works fine. However in case of a Disaster recovery we need to have availability to those shared folders from the second site.

So initialy we were planing to use FSlogix with DFS shared folders for user data and that DFS folders will be accessible between both sites.

However there are recommendations to avoid using FSlogix + DFS due to sync network issues. Instead of using DFS there are some recommendations of using other options such as SOFS.

Does anybody has any experience with SOFS + FSlogix? Is it really better than using DFS?

Config mgr 2309 hotfix (Ready to install)  
Config mgr 2403 (stuck on downloading state with failing to download redist)

To give you a bit of context as to how it could have happened, the server was upgraded from 2012 R2 to 2022. The console stopped connecting to the SCCM server as soon as the server was upgraded. The WSUS was not connecting either with an error message ""DB version is higher than WSUS""

I have a second question as well. My account activity shows occasional successful sign ins from my IP address even though I didn't sign in.

646,646,Microsoft,How has been your overall experience using Microsoft services in your personal life including phone?,"I have never been much of a microsoft/windows guy, especially since after all my years studying computer science / sysadmin and networking, I only used linux.

I've been working for a year after finishing my studies and I have had to accustom myself back to Windows. I pretty much only used Windows for gaming before, but after my experience working with Windows, and basically all the microsoft HUGE suite of services, I've changed my mind about it and considering the possibility of switching to using microsoft as personal account.

I've been always using google as my personal account, and I've tried quickly switching to microsoft but found 2 main problems:

* Compatibility with phones is not ideal. Google controls phone market alongside apple, and while you have all the app in the play store for microsoft, I think you get what I mean that switching to microsfot products on a phone would feel weird. Correct me if I'm wrong but, how has been your experience using microsoft in your phone? (taking into account you don't have a windows phone, those are already dead of course)
* Logins in websites. Pretty much every website nowadays allows you to login with your google account, only a few allow microsoft logins. Of course you could just create an account manually and use your microsoft account but It'd be slower. The practicality a Google account offers you in this regard wins over microsoft.

Finally, I just basically want your opinions on using microsoft services for everything in your personal life. I'm a guy that prefers harmony in his digital environment, meaning I try to aim to have everything as centralised as I can. In my work I just use microsoft, so I have no problems trying to switch to microsoft for a personal account and my headaches between platforms would be reduced and everything would be smoother.

Example: I've been used to create A LOT of outlook rules to control mail traffic, in google it's not the same and it's a bit worse. Now if I want to organise my mail in google, I have to think, whether if I just used a microsoft account, I already have that knowledge and just used it in my personal account. Just a small example so you get my point :)

I'd love to hear your thoughts, I've been always a linux nazi basically, but life is about adapting to your current situation so I'm trying to adapt and have an open mind, thanks!

Yesterday I received 3 emails from microsoft regarding an account breach in my junk folder which I believed to be your usual spam.

Googling the email address I found mixed reviews saying it was either fake or real but could also be spoofed so I went to check my sign in activity & noticed log in attempts being made as far back as the history would allow me to go which was about 3 months & they were being made more than 10 times per day from multiple countries around the world (40+ countries).

Every single attempt made had been unsuccessful which I guess is why I did not receive any emails from microsoft all this time as I've been completely unaware about these log in attempts but surely I should have still been sent an email telling me that someone has been trying to access my account & the only emails I received which was yesterday I only got because my account had finally gotten successfully logged in at the exact same time from 3 different countries.

What I don't understand is how microsofts system have even allowed this to happen without detecting the account being logged into from 3 countries at the same exact time.

I have 2FA linked to this account which clearly they found a way to bypass this as you need a text message code sent to my phone to sign in.

I don't know how to stop this from happening as I've since changed my password, signed out from all devices & even added a gmail account for extra security but I'm still getting log in attempts & account sync attempts from all over the world.

660,660,Microsoft,Received 91703 text messages from Microsoft b2b days for both of my emails?

That got my attention so I went to log in Email #1 and it was gave me the ""**you'll receive sign-in requests on your device**."", so I checked my phone, approved it but then it wanted me to enter either my biometrics or my PIN. Since I didn't set this up, I didn't have this information but I was able to select ""Use password instead"" on the browser and log in.

Sign-In activity shows that there was Successful Sign-in (near my area) right before the text message, both Browser and Device is  Unknown but its my IP address and Session Activity states ""Security info added"". It looks like a new ""Sign-In Or Verify option for Outlook Mobile app was added but it wasn't me. Email #2 has the exact same data point.

Email #1 had 2-step enabled, Email #2 did not.

Did anybody else experienced this? I have been searching and see 91703 in reference to being hacked. I have changed both passwords and removed that sign-in via Outlook Mobile app. One more thing, all the subsequent security change notifications did from 91703.

We strive to conduct interviews with our users, and they mostly say they use Letterly for:

1. Quickly composing lengthy **messages**
2. Taking **notes** and capturing **thoughts** when typing isn’t convenient
3. Turning ramblings into **social media posts**



There have been rumors that iOS 18 will include transcription and summarization in the Voice Memos app. At first, we were concerned, but then we decided to focus on making Letterly even better. Not everyone uses Apple Music, Apple Notes, Apple Calendar, or Apple Health – people find alternatives. Here’s what we’re planning:

1. We already offer **more than just summaries**, including various text rewriting options like “Correct grammar”, ""Structured text"" or “LinkedIn Post”
2. We have a **widget** for quick audio capture when you need to record immediately.
3. We’ll add **custom ways to rewrite text**, enabling users to train the AI to produce texts that perfectly match their style.
4. **Regular updates** with new features every week or month, so you won’t have to wait years for improvements.
5. **Integrations** with Notion, Asana, and more, allowing quick text transfers to your preferred platforms.
6. Availability on Android (already) and Web (coming soon), so you can easily **switch between devices**.
7. Faster text generation with features like **auto-copying**.

I expect that we will come up with many more ideas! I would also appreciate it if you could advise on how to effectively differentiate.

By the way, we've involved linguists to help train the model, making sure the texts turn out really good.

708,708,Apple,"[iOS, macOS] Music app for musicians and singers","Pocket Jam is an app for musicians and singers that want to practise or play along to music. It lets you adjust the pitch and tempo of a song, mark specific times in a song, and loop sections of a song

It has what I think is the best looping of any app I've tried - you can start slow, and increase the tempo by a small amount with every loop, until you reach the desired tempo

If you need to play outside of the app, you can also export the songs with your pitch and tempo adjustments

The UI is heavily inspired by Apple Music with a background themed using the album art. I focused a lot on making the UI simple and easy to understand. If you've used any similar apps with similar features to Pocket Jam, hopefully this UI should be a breath of fresh air

It supports playing songs from Files as well streaming with Apple Music - although streaming does not support pitch adjustments (I'd love to add it if Apple provides a way to do this) and exporting (this one should be clear why). It is not possible to support Spotify due to their incredibly restrictive licensing

Future things I'm thinking about is a live activity to make it easier to control from your home screen, as well as other music providers like SoundCloud

I'd love to know what you think, or if you have any more ideas!

710,710,Apple,"[Self-promo Sunday] Hi Reddit, I'm half of the team behind Halide. We just launched a new pro video camera called Kino! Come check it out, let us know what you think and get a promo code while they last","Hey Reddit!

I'm u/caliform, 50% of Lux, the team behind Halide, a camera app for iPhone and iPad which turned seven (7!) last week. To celebrate, we released a new camera app: Kino.

(if you want to skip my long post about it, you can find out more about it here: http://shotwithkino.com)

Kino has been a long time in the works. We always wanted to do a video app - and we got started with Spectre and recently Orion, our free app for turning your iPad into an HDMI monitor. Last year we felt like we had a shot to do this before Ben, the other half of the team, would have his baby, so we posted this video.

Well, babies choose their own due dates 😅. Ben's baby Ethan came early - so Ben went on a brief leave, and Kino spent a bit more time in the oven.

[So here's Kino!](http://shotwithkino.com/download) Kino's whole idea is that like Halide, it's easy enough for beginners to take beautiful cinematic video but work great for pros.

To do that, we include a set of presets made by some awesome pros: Tyler Stalman, Stu Maschwitz, Evan Schneider, Kevin Ong, and Sandwich Video. Also me (Sebastiaan de With)! You can apply these to video on your iPhone in a tap, so you get a pro color grade without having to do any editing. Especially nice on iPhone 15 Pro with Log footage, which skips a lot of processing. You can also apply them to footage later (including footage from other apps).

We do some clever auto-exposure with a feature called 'AutoMotion'. In brief, without getting technical, it optimizes for that nice cinematic motion look you get in film rather than average iPhone shots. No need to tweak settings - just look for 'Auto' to turn green (ND filter in daylight recommended).

It also packs in a ton of pro features - an RGB waveform, layout guides, custom recording presets, audio device levels / connecting, USB-C external drive support, saving to Photos or Files, loading custom LUTs, and a whole lot more.

Now, this \*is\* a v1.0. We have lots of things we're adding even in v1.1, and huge plans for the app going forward. But we wanted to get it in people's hands and see what people like, what they want, and how it's used. :)

Kino was launched on Halide's 7th anniversary, and that's no coincidence. We're really humbled that we have managed to make a job out of making apps, and we hope that you trust us to keep working on making it better and being right on top of new developments in iOS and iPhone.

Reddit has always been awesome for us — a place to get honest feedback, great community and more. I'd love to hear what you think of the app, and answer any questions (AMA!)!

Thanks for reading all that ([I'm sorry for you, or glad that happened](https://i.kym-cdn.com/entries/icons/original/000/034/711/Screen_Shot_2020-07-24_at_11.33.38_AM.jpg)) — I'll check in through the day with our promo codes til they're out!.

There are other apps that do this, but mine has 11 typefaces sampled from real typewriters in addition to the Courier and Menlo system fonts.  All the processing takes place on your phone and you can make real-time adjustments.  The look and feel was inspired by a pre-war black and chrome typewriter with glass keys.

774,774,Apple,[Summer Update] In 2023 I wanted to challenge myself to make a well designed app for weightlifting - here's IronIQ,"[IronIQ](https://ironiq.app/) was made to challenge myself in creating something insanely great. A free, sleek & private gym notebook with no limits.

[About 6 months ago I launched IronIQ on /r/apple .](https://www.reddit.com/r/apple/comments/18vedei/in_2023_i_wanted_to_challenge_myself_to_make_a/) You guys gave me such awesome feedback, I had a lot of fun making improvements to the app over the past 6 months so wanted to post an update. 

**Huge changes & improvements:** 

* IronIQ has no ads & is even more private. 
* The design is even better.
* Apple Watch & Apple Health integration.
* Built-in support for the most popular workout routines around (PPL, PHUL, 5x5, etc.)
* Plate weight calculator.
* Exercise & routine notes.
* Streaks, autofill sets & calculate weight increases, Apple Music playlists, exercise how-to's & more!
* There’s plenty[ more info on the product website](https://ironiq.app), & [here’s a few screenshots](https://www.reddit.com/user/RIP_Apollo_17-23/comments/1d135vz/ironiq_screenshots/). 

**What’s next:**

* I’m wrapping up a simplified Mac version to create workouts on your home computer.
* Whatever you want! Shoot me a DM or contact me using the in-app feedback link & I’ll built anything.

**A few common questions:**

The App Privacy page has no personalized data, but some anonymized data captured, why?

* I use [the very cool GDPR compliant TelemetryDeck](https://telemetrydeck.com/privacy/) to get a rough idea of app use while needing no identifiable information or private data.
* It’s a bit unclear as to what counts as “data collection” - all health & workout put in IronIQ stays with your iCloud account, & I don’t have a server collecting it, but technically the app is “collecting” the data to save to Apple Health, so I’d rather be more transparent than not.

How is this app different from Strong / Some Other App I Use:

* If you have a great app you use, that’s awesome! I don’t want to disparage anyone else’s amazing work. Please do me & them a favor by doing the same.
* I’ll highlight a few reasons I love IronIQ - the design is a total departure from most other products, no personal identifiable information leaves your iCloud, there’s no limits or paywalls at all, it’s feature rich, & it’s all Swift.
* IronIQ is a competitor to your paper notebook. If you’re paying for an app, stick to it & support the developer you like!

How are you able to make this app free?

* I built IronIQ with super deep integration to your iPhone. For you to enjoy unlimited workouts, I don’t need to store them on some server I’m paying for, etc.
* I just work on this because it’s fun & cool. I love to workout & will keep improving on it even if I was the only user.
* There’s in-app purchases to throw me a bone & unlock customization features (custom themes, streaks emoji, etc) 

Do I need an account?

* No! You can skip account creation and use all the core features (notebook, iCloud sync, ec) totally fine! You just can't use any AI features.

As a thanks for all the awesome feedback & support, use code [BIGREDDITOR](https://apps.apple.com/redeem?ctx=offercodes&id=6448133170&code=BIGREDDITOR) to get custom themes for free until fall.

If you’ve fallen off the wagon, now is a GREAT time to get back into working out. Any feedback, ideas, or just gym talk – I'm all ears!

804,804,Apple,Making sense of the deleted photos bug in iOS 17.5,"Before getting into the Photos app, it would be best to explain how computers typically delete data. The way deletion works is that the data is simply unallocated and unindexed in storage. While the content disappears from the user in the OS, it is still technically written in storage until some other data overwrites it down the road. Now since the data and filesystem is encrypted with the on-device encryption key, the only way the content can come back is if the OS can decrypt the data stored. 

With 17.5.1, an explanation given for photos coming back is ""database corruption"". ""Database corruption"" makes sense in this context because people who have been using the same device for a long while have the same on-device encryption key. Whenever there are significant changes to first party apps, there's database upgrades that happen in the background to ensure the content remains, and updating to 17.5 likely caused a bug where it reindexed and reallocated the deleted photos because they hadn't been overwritten on storage (and were written to storage with the same encryption).

As for the photos coming back after erasing the device and giving it to someone else, something needs to be cleared up: as far as I've seen, there has only been **one** reported instance of this happening, by one user on reddit, not more. People love playing a game of telephone but this does nothing but stir things beyond the facts. This is still a serious problem, but stretching it beyond the facts just spins up a lot of nonsensical conspiracy theories and nothing useful comes out of it. I also can't find the original comment as it seems they deleted it. 

Now, assuming that this single claim was legitimate in the first place, the only plausible explanation is when the device was restored/erased, the on-device encryption key changed and became the exact same key, or it never changed during the restore process (which is a serious problem if it is true). Combine this with the bug in the Photos app specifically, it likely managed to reindex and reallocate the deleted photos because of the key remaining the same, thus the content being legible.

Now this is all from my own understanding of how it all works, and could very well not be fully accurate, it's just the most logical explanation for why any of this is possible without giving any conspiracies the spotlight. Hopefully it all makes sense.",1716310699.0,NEGATIVE,0.9988428354263306

This short film aims to be a reminder that, even though we could replace everything with a display, it doesn’t mean we have to, that less is not always more.

829,829,Apple,I built an Apple Watch app for serious runners,"The last few years I’ve slowly built an app that aims to rival my friends’ Garmin watches. 

After getting more into running I kept pondering whether to get a Garmin, which all serious runners seemed to have, or stick with my Watch. I didn’t find an app that integrated with the coaching I used at the time (RunCoach) and was jealous of the Garmin’s PacePro feature to setup negative splits and structured workouts.

But right before pressing “Submit order” I figured “wait, I’m a developer, how hard could this be to build myself?”

WELL, a couple of years later, with tonnes of feedback from dedicated users, I finally have a pretty decent app. Turns out it was surprisingly hard to get everything right for runners who wanted more than what other apps provided.

It has become my baby, the app I’m always working on and also using everyday for training and races. Keep tweaking and adding features.

The app is called Watchletic and it’s mostly FREE. Currently the premium subscription is to integrate with coaching services and planning your workouts. 

Please let me know what you think and know that I’m very open to feedback and feature requests. Most of the app is built from features that users requested.

899,899,Apple,New big update for Reprice: Price Tracker. Looking for feedback & Giveaway,"Hi, I've recently released a big update of my app ""Reprice: Price Tracker"" which, other than tracking amazon prices, now also tracks any other site (or almost, there might be complex sites difficult to track).  
I created this app originally for Amazon price tracking but, compared to existing apps, I wanted a better UX and then I kept adding more and more features.

It also tracks the majority of Amazon sites (India, Egypt, Emirates, etc..) and it contains a section where you can see other people deals.  
With the free version you can track up to 10 products (from any site) and then you can unlock premium with just 0.99$/month.  
Would love to have some feedback, if you're interested into trying the Premium version for free for a month, please leave a comment and I'll reach you in DM (Have 20 subs left to giveaway).

901,901,Apple,"I made an app to help with saving useful knowledge/snippets/quotes from online & books and setting up quick reminders -- More like a ""mindful consumption"" tool which I think many will find useful here. - Memori Note","Hi all,

I know we all struggle with information overload these days - whether it's books, articles, videos , ideas or just random thoughts floating around in our heads. So I decided to create Memori Note - app store link -- https://apps.apple.com/us/app/memori-notes/id6449470045

[Memori note -- My website showcasing example of how to use the app and feautures](https://www.memorinote.com)

This app is designed to be your personal knowledge hub, helping you capture and organize all those ideas, quotes, and snippets that you want to revisit later. -- No more losing your inspirations in the chaos of hundreds of open tabs and half-filled notebooks!

**Here's what Memori Note App can do for you:**

- 🔍 Quickly set reminders in just a few clicks for anything important - As opposed to Google keep, you can set reminders with 50% fewer clicks.

- 🔀 ""Shuffle"" feature - tap it to rediscover a random note or quote from your collection when you're feeling bored or have spare free time.

- 📖 ""Reading Mode"" for distraction-free note viewing and easily swiping between notes.

- 📚 Categorize your notes with tags and colours to keep things organized.

Plus, it's got a simple, aesthetic design that's easy on the eyes and highly customizable(Themes, background, and even roundness because some people prefer a more round look, some more squarish so I made sure it works for all).

**Why I made it?**

-I found it hard to keep up with so much information from all the books I read, from online articles I read, from 100+ tabs on Google that are open ""to read at some point..."" and I am not even going to mention all the Instagram reels that are under ""save"" category that I never get to go over or I completely forget about it. 3+ note books that are half full, my to do app i use ""ticktick"" that has so many mix of notes and to do and while i find it super helpful for ""aggressive"" type reminders, as in tick tick shows notification on top of your screen so you can't just swipe it off you need to click something, done snooze etc, so not easy to forget those reminders. 


-But I wanted something that would gather my notes, random thoughts, quotes from the book << most importantly, and some cool youtube videos or reels, that i would want to go back at some point in life. And most importantly having quick UI specifically for a reminder system. (I love Google Keep, but my 500+ notes tend to get forgotten due to quite a complex system of setting up simple reminders, at least 10 clicks to set up a simple date and time and reoccurrence) that was one of the main reasons I decided to learn coding and make my own app.

-Another reason, surprisingly no note app has ""shuffle button"" where you can just ""shuffle"" through your notes, or quotes, or a way to swipe through your notes. So yeah that's why I made my app to include such features and to help me with organizing my thoughts a little bit better, so I hope many will find it useful aswell!

904,904,Apple,"Klack for macOS - Fresh of the press, juicy update","It's been a while!

For anyone that has no idea what Klack even is, nothing explains it better than the official website but in short, it adds satisfying keyboard sounds as you type, each individually recorded to be unique for every single key. It also uses pitching and rate to further randomise the audio output's originality. It has 4 very carefully curated switch sets for everyones personal preference.

  
Tip: you can preview the sounds by pressing play on the landing page.

Just released a complete rewrite of Klack in the form of an update last week. Should honestly have been Klack 2.0 but like I've said from the beginning, I don't want to double dip, meaning I would never recharge for Klack again, it will keep getting updates for free during its lifetime.

I wanted to take a moment to tell you about the new features I've added to the latest update

The newest update brings support for graphing equations. It's quite new, it's not 100% where I want it to be at the moment - it still has some features I'd like to add. As such, it's not advertised in the app listing, but it is there and working!

The last update added support for undo and redo using the system's three-finger swipe gesture.  You've always been able to add a few shortcuts as swipe gestures on the calculator keyboard - and today, you can now add undo and redo as gestures

Happy to answer any and every question about the app, app development or any other questions you might have!

976,976,Apple,Big update to my Ulti-Planner iOS Calendar that now includes Mac.,"Hi apple,

I recently released a big update to my iPhone and iPad calendar planner app Ulti-Planner. The biggest addition is that it is now also a ***Mac App***. But I have made a whole bunch of other changes and additions to refine the app, including adding ***goals*** for habit tracking and ***focus sessions****,* to increase your productivity.

Our ultimate goal is to be mentioned right next to the big names in Apple calendars like Fantastical and Readdle, but bringing you an experience superior to them and at a more reasonable price point. We hope you check it out and agree that in some areas we've gotten there.

&#x200B;

For those not familiar with our app, in is a full featured organizer based on experience from over 14 years in the Appstore.  It has features like reminders, calendar filters, templates, natural language, embedded lists, icons, tags, and weather in 5 customizable calendar views, along with contacts and now goals and focus sessions.  
And we have a full *project* management module that allows for *Kanban* based project management with drag-n-drop and customizable column statuses.

We did build the app so the ***FREE*** version is a flexible calendar tool that works great for a lot of people without a lot of annoying upselling going on. And then we hope you experiment with the free trial to see the advances that the Premium version offers.

  
We hope you give it a try! And watch for another great round up updates coming soon...

982,982,Apple,Am I the only one that's becoming bored of Apple's stuff lately?,"It was one thing having been burnt out by iPhones thanks to having been forced to update to their latest versions of iOS TWICE now because of their boot loop issues, but it's another when a lot of their releases have been becoming so dang STALE lately. The iPads have been looking similar with very minimal updates given to them, these M chips haven't been as appealing as it has been the first time around. Their iPhones have ben becoming more and more unappealing with their forced changes to the devices and their software especially. (Like who really asked for an Action Button on iPhones? And why must it replace the mute switch?) The one thing that made these Macs more worth it for me the Touch Bar had these feeling more samey nowadays. And with the next Apple Event coming up in a few days, it really feels like there really isn't much that makes them worth looking forward to.

 Between all that, their iPads all basically looking the exact same and being the same thing outside of size and chips and the whole thing about them all being so dang anti-consumer in terms of reparability, it really makes Apple a company that has lost its muster nowadays personally speaking. The only things they got right now that was more worth keeping an eye nowadays were their Vision Pro and to a lesser extent their Apple TV line. Or at least the Apple TV Plus lineup, but even that's not saying much when a lot of the content nowadays is nothing but live action stuff geared towards a more adult audience.",1714869221.0,NEGATIVE,0.9988699555397034

I managed to get a new monitor at a really good price, so I'm kind of committed to using it and won't play at 1080p. I am considering this card because it is considerably cheaper than an RX 7700 XT (which is cheaper than an RX 6800 XT in good condition) here in Argentina.

From what I've seen, I know it relies on DLSS to get past 60fps in the most demanding games (at max settings), which seems terrible only for the very high-end expectations, but I don't think it would be so bad. If I can play everything at max settings at 60fps, then I think it's okay (I'm okay with giving up RT in some games, I would have to do the same with an AMD card). So, I want to read some real-life experiences with this card for 1440p gaming to know if I have the correct expectations.

&#x200B;

My intention is to acquire an **RTX 4060** to primarily handle encoding, but I have some questions about compatibility between the components:

&#x200B;

Could I face encoding overload issues because both processors and motherboards use PCIe 3.0? Is ReBar necessary in this case?

Only now 4080s prices are starting to dip towards 1100$, which starts to look like a bargain.

1013,1013,Nvidia,"When overclocking Nvidia 4000 series GPUs, why does MSI Afterburner shift whole curve?","When I oc by +150MHz on GPU, it shifts all points on voltage-frequency curve by 150MHz and its like this:

* 1600 becomes 1750 at same voltage
* 1700 becomes 1850 at same voltage

...

* 2600 becomes 2750 at same voltage

Why? Overclocking 1600MHz point by +150MHz is nearly 10% overclock but overclocking 2600MHz point by 150 is only 5%. How can GPU be overclocked higher on one point and only half on another point? I'd expect same percentage on all points, something like +150MHz on 2600 and +75MHz on 1300.

What is the physics behind this? Perhaps overclocking potential is not linear to original frequency?

The original curve is already non-linear. But what MSI afterburner applies is linear, so the resulting curve shape is exactly same and just shifted upwards. Then, I guess, the point the GPU can run stable at 100MHz could easily become 250MHz too? That's 150% overclock! Go further, find the voltage for the GPU to run at 10 MHz. Bump it 150MHz, bingo its 1400% overclock.

I tested my gpu with plain OC from +100 to +200 and its only stable with +150 but higher points of curve have no problem with +200. Some benchmarks even run with +250 MHz. I want it to set the oc only highest parts of curve but it forces the curve to do a smooth transition which breaks lower frequencies' stability. I want the real oc only after certain voltage like 1.01V but it applies smoothed increments from 0.97V to 1.0V too. I guess GPU doesn't like the sudden jump of frequency for lifespan or there's a bug with Afterburner.",1717357329.0,NEGATIVE,0.9984556436538696

1. Asus ROG Strix RTX 4070 ti super 0C Edition

2. Zotac Trinity RTX 4080 super 

  
They are priced the same at $1500, and I can't seem to make the decision of which. I am based in asia, Singapore, where prices of computer parts are higher. 

# Zotac 4080 Super

**Pros**

**-** 20% percent faster than 4070 ti super

- Option for 4k in future.(Currently using 3440 \* 1440(main) and 1920\*1080 monitors).

**Cons**

**-** Don't like the design look of it.

- Weight is lighter compared to the 4070 ti super(Build quality may not be as good?)



# ROG 4070 ti super

**Pros**

**-** Looks really good, RGB lighting and all.

- Feels heavier and build quality may be better?

  
**Cons**

**-** 20% percent slower.

  
The ROG feels more sturdy in terms of build(based off the weight) and looks better, but I also value the 4080 super's future proofness. If I were to get a ROG 4080 super, it would $1800 and out of budget. It mostly whether I value performance > looks or looks > performance. ",1717346961.0,NEGATIVE,0.9933214783668518

*  Did Nvidia made a big difference between the 4070 TI and the 4070 TI Super?
* Does the the manufacturer (besides the mother having 2vs3 fans) has that much of an impact? 

I was looking at the prices and at lest for the TI Super side i was wondering why we have a 30 to 50 USD difference when most of them look the same to me.

Is it just aesthetics or is more about material quality?

Oh I’m also interested in DLSS3 which from my understanding isn’t officially compatible with my 3060 which sucks.The thing that worries me is that I know that my actual card is amazing , and I feel like getting one with less ram would give me basically the same experience and results more or less. If could help I run a Ryzen 5500 and 16gb of ram ddr4. 

I’d get the new card for around 350, even less if we count id probably sell the old one for at least 150 I guess .

1025,1025,Nvidia,4070Ti - need help undervolting please?,"TUF 4070 TI OC


Hi there. About a month ago I purchased the above card brand new. Love the card, the temps are great and power draw is way lower than I expected (coming from a 3080…).

Only issue I have is coil whine. It’s the loudest I’ve seen on a GPU and I’m struggling to ignore it. It’s been a month and it has not improved at all. Obviously it’s loudest on higher demanding games / when fps caps are set higher. I game on a 1440p 165hz screen so it often leads to whine-inducing uses.

I want to do everything I can digitally before I go down the RMA path. I’ve done things life capping fps / VSYNC but they’re not quite enough.

I wanted to try undervolting, which I’ve never done. But every guide I’ve found is focused on improving temps and marginally increasing performance, neither of which I’m particularly after. Of course they’d be welcome benefits.

So I just wanted to ask if anyone with a TUF OC 4070ti had undervolted, what settings would you recommend and is this likely to help with could whine at all?

Thanks! ",1717333398.0,NEGATIVE,0.9980039000511169

1040,1040,Nvidia,RTX 4060 8GB or RTX 3060 12GB for general/multipurpose use?,"Hello.

I recently got a pc (went with Ryzen 7 5700G as the cpu because I didn't have the funds to get a gpu at the time) and was looking for a good gpu option for general use.

The best options I have in my price range (as well as availability) are the 4060 and the 3060 12gb brand new.

I don't play recent game releases that demand a lot of vram and only plan to play at 1080p at best. I'm currently playing Monster Hunter World at a low resolution with average 55fps but would like a higher resolution.

I consider any fps past 60 as amazing.

I'll be testing the gpu with Batman: Arkham Knight at max, maybe Control at whatever the gpu limits are at.

I'll also be using it for stuff like video editing, UE5 (for mostly basic stuff since I'm just starting out), and anything else that would benefit from a dedicated gpu.

For the price range, the two are roughly similar in pricing and are available in the shop I frequently visit, and I don't plan on upgrading for a while since I'll be saving up for an eventual AM5 build which will definitely have high-end specs and gpu.

Thanks in advance.

**Update:**  
After reading and answering some comments, the 4060 looks to be the better choice.  
I've also done a bit more reading myself and came to the same conclusion myself.

I'll be checking the comments a bit more for the next few days then finalize my choice once I have decided when I'll buy the gpu.

Either that, or I have no idea what ""coil whine"" sounds like. Everyone keeps saying ASUS cards have this, but it really doesn't. And it's really nice to invest in a GPU that can shut up during high load. You can hear the fans go off but it doesn't sound too loud or bad, and the card stays cool. Not like the card I replaced. The RTX 2070 Windforce 2X by Gigabyte is probably the worst graphics card I'd ever owned. It had fan rattling due to the cheap plastic assembly, so any time it spun up it did this repetitive gas-up noise.

I have to wonder why people hate ASUS so much. Seems like they're the overall best third party brand, to me, and honestly I'd choose this over the FE because I have so many issues with my overheating CPU, so defaulting to 71+ degrees is out of the question, and the TUF stays around 67-ish during gaming.

I'm really satisfied, even though the pricing is edging a bit too close to the 4080, but the 4080 uses the 4090 heatsink and wouldn't have fit in my PC case.",1717291684.0,NEGATIVE,0.9914178848266602

1046,1046,Nvidia,4060 TI 8GB or 16GB for 35€ more?,"I know these cards are all overpriced and the memory bus 128 bit is BS, but the reality is as is. Because of some special discounts and my company reimbursing me 50% of the cost, the price differences between cards are a bit different on my case:

- 4060 TI 8GB - 190€
- 4060 TI 16GB - 225€
- 4070 12G  - 270€

My budget is around 200€ but I can justify a few more bucks if it's a card that will last more. 

I determined the performance I need is around the 4060 TI but because of these price differences being lower than normal, I'm wondering if I should spend a bit more for the 16GB version.

Will the 16GB last a few more years or all will be outdated about the same? I read some games already use more than 8Gb but the majority of the cards is still at 8GB or lower... 

I know the 4070 is the best card but it's 80€ more and I only game a few hours per week, most the time PC is for work so I prefer a quieter, cooler GPU. I can stretch the budget if 4070 would last 1 or 2 generations more than the 4060 TI but otherwise 4060 TI is enough for me (I think). 

&nbsp;

CPU is AMD 5800X. I really love nvidia power/performance efficiency as I like quieter, cooler PCs and with the 4060 I can very likely keep my PSU (current GPU is RX 5700 rated at 180W TDP). I would game 1080p highest settings and 1440p for less demanding games (2 monitors).

I heard that people said that if the 12VHPWR voltages drop too low it might mean that the connector is not properly seated and will melt. I got scared because normally when I boot up my PC the voltages are around 12.070-12.100 but now it was 11.960 and barely hit 12.040. I reseated the connector and now it's normal again. Could that mean that the cable is coming loose by itself? It's not in a tight space since I have a huge PC case and there is lots of room  
  
The voltages for the 12VHPWR fluctuate quite a bit and sometimes restarting the PC makes the numbers go high.

I did, buying a used 3070 to keep using my computer in between.

Five weeks later I got the card back. They had done nothing. To add insult to injury, they had also wrapped the card in an old antistatic bag full of holes and old labels.

1132,1132,Nvidia,An Impression of Micro Center's Refurbished RTX 3080 Ti FE: Becoming a Good Deal?,"Hello all,

Micro Center has been selling refurbished 3000 series Founders Edition cards for some time now and while the prices were questionable previously, the prices have started to fall (finally). Here I am writing a <24 hour impression with once such card I bought, a RTX 3080 Ti FE, and the condition of the GPU. The two-slot design of this card makes this particularly enticing for SFFPC builds.

The GPU was listed as open box for $424.96, \~$450 after tax. The GPU comes in a nondescript cardboard box with adequate foam padding. Upon inspection in the store (which you are allowed to do on open box items, not for newly packaged items) the GPU was unopened from its antistatic bag and came with a newly packaged Nvidia-branded 12VHPWR adapter. I suspect this was a purchase and return.

https://preview.redd.it/9oa4yplq5t2d1.jpg?width=4000&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=09d38d24eb5b7f62234442871b903c4911b7be95

During my inspection of the card I did not see any previous fingerprints, nicks, scratches, or other evidence of damage to the card shroud, suggesting that these are factory refurbished. I also did not observe dust or residue under the GPU heatsink that I have seen with uncleaned used and mined cards. The fans look brand new without signs of use or unevenness when spinning the fan blades. The 12VHPWR connector is clean without burn marks or melted plastic. The only evidence of previous use to these cards is at the PCI-e pins on the card, which do have marks on them. These observations do not exclude the possibility that these were previously mined on but they have at least certainly been given a good clean and treatment. I have not opened up this GPU to determine the condition of the thermal pads or paste.

Upon stress-testing the GPU stabilizes at 81-82°C, reaching \~1900 MHz core clock and \~9500 MHz memory clock while drawing 340W of power. There is some minor coil whine that is drowned out by the GPU fan noise, which is at levels that I would expect from a reference design. Synthetic benchmarks reach levels around the median reported scores for other 3080 Tis, which is reassuring that this particular card has not suffered much degradation (and in line with testing from other sources regarding used GPUs). In my in-game testing with Tetris Effect and Battlefield 4 at 1440p I have not noticed any graphical glitches or defects. Overall performance is what I would expect for a new 3080 Ti FE.

https://preview.redd.it/b70sbw8u5t2d1.png?width=1372&format=png&auto=webp&s=e0d0a1656c01c12a7288a12cc29f0a7fdf8b5d06

These GPUs come with hassle-free 90-day warranty but can also have 2 or 3 year purchase protection plans where Micro Center will give you the amount in store credit. Whether or not the additional warranty purchase is worth it is up to user discretion. (I personally think that the imminent risk of hardware failure is low given that these cards are past the initial part of the ""bathtub curve."")

The other closest competitors in this price point (after open-box discount in my case) and performance are the $400 4060 Ti 8GB, $550 4070 12GB, $600 4070 Super 12GB, and $480 RX 7800 XT 16GB. The pure rasterization performance, higher memory bandwidth on the 3080 Ti, and DLSS2 support are very compelling, especially for 4K gaming. High power draw and thermals is a big downside to these cards--but this is user-dependent, and as someone who doesn't game 24/7, the math doesn't add up in terms of power consumption. For me, at \~4hr gaming/wk, it would take me 6.5 years for the electricity cost to surpass the price difference between the 3080 Ti and the cheapest but similarly performing 4070 Super, which could be further improved with undervolting. The other downside is the lack of support for frame gen and DLSS3, which also depends on the user as to whether these features are useful.

I believe that the prices of this card will continue to drop given the high inventory in some stores. With further discounts or open-box deals I believe these refurbished GPUs should be given serious consideration for folks looking into FE cards for their build.

It is likely that different systems GPU/CPU will behave differently with the various drivers. 1080ti is from 2017 and so is i8700k.

I did go the whole sunshine moonlight thingy however Input lag is just too much playing Fortnite/witcher/cyberpunk plus I could only run at 60hz and image quality just wasn’t th same. I live in Sydney.

Recommended products that WILL work is much appreciated thank you !

Edit: thanks for the replies so far. I guess given my own research where it seems to me long range usb AND hdmi cables are fiddly and the fact there are many foreign/ Chinese suppliers on Amazon that may not deliver on the product advertised what I’m really asking here is this. Is anyone actively using a 15m (or more ) hdmi 2.1 cable that is delivering 4K hdr 120hz without any issues from Australia and if so where did you buy it from ? And same goes with the usb cable question. Thanks a lot! 

Edit 28/5: thanks again for everyone’s help. Decided to test out a cheap 15m fiber optic cable from FIBBR from Amazon and while I didn’t expect it to work it actually did ! 4K @ 120hz, ALL and VRR (gsync) enabled, been using for 2 days and no issues so far. Only cost 78aud.

I then also bought the monoprice 49ft usb 2.0 active cable again from Amazon and attached a ugreen 5.4 Bluetooth adaptor to it. Was stuttery at first but needed to fully disable mobo Bluetooth from device manager and restart then all works perfectly !

Now just need to find a way to hide the cables :)",1716630601.0,NEGATIVE,0.9824687242507935

## CEO Comments

>“The next industrial revolution has begun — companies and countries are partnering with NVIDIA to shift the trillion-dollar traditional data centers to accelerated computing and build a new type of data center — AI factories — to produce a new commodity: artificial intelligence,” said Jensen Huang, founder and CEO of NVIDIA. “AI will bring significant productivity gains to nearly every industry and help companies be more cost- and energy-efficient, while expanding revenue opportunities.  
>  
>“Our data center growth was fueled by strong and accelerating demand for generative AI training and inference on the Hopper platform. Beyond cloud service providers, generative AI has expanded to consumer internet companies, and enterprise, sovereign AI, automotive and healthcare customers, creating multiple multibillion-dollar vertical markets.  
>  
>“We are poised for our next wave of growth. The Blackwell platform is in full production and forms the foundation for trillion-parameter-scale generative AI. Spectrum-X opens a brand-new market for us to bring large-scale AI to Ethernet-only data centers. And NVIDIA NIM is our new software offering that delivers enterprise-grade, optimized generative AI to run on CUDA everywhere — from the cloud to on-prem data centers and RTX AI PCs — through our expansive network of ecosystem partners.”

|**Total**|**$26,044**|**$7,192**|**+262%**|

* Revenue was a record $26.0 billion, up 262% from a year ago and up 18% sequentially
* Data Center revenue was a record, up 427% from a year ago and up 23% sequentially. Data Center compute revenue was $19.4 billion, up 478% from a year ago and up 29% sequentially. These increases reflect higher shipments of the NVIDIA Hopper GPU computing platform used for training and inferencing with large language models, recommendation engines, and generative AI applications. Networking revenue was $3.2 billion, up 242% from a year ago on strong growth of InfiniBand end-to-end solutions, and down 5% sequentially due to the timing of supply. Strong sequential Data Center growth was driven by all customer types, led by Enterprise and Consumer Internet companies. Large cloud providers continued to drive strong growth as they deploy and ramp NVIDIA AI infrastructure at scale, representing mid-40% of our Data Center revenue.
* Gaming revenue was up 18% from a year ago and down 8% sequentially. The year-on-year increase primarily reflects higher demand. The sequential decrease reflects seasonally lower GPU sales for laptops.
* Professional Visualization revenue was up 45% from a year ago and down 8% sequentially. The yearon-year increase primarily reflects higher sell-in to partners following the normalization of channel inventory levels. The sequential decrease was primarily due to desktop workstation GPUs.
* Automotive revenue was up 11% from a year ago and up 17% sequentially. The year-on-year increase was driven primarily by self-driving platforms. The sequential increase was driven by AI Cockpit solutions and self-driving platforms.
* GAAP and non-GAAP gross margins for the first quarter increased significantly from a year ago on strong Data Center revenue growth primarily driven by our Hopper GPU computing platform. Sequentially, GAAP and non-GAAP gross margins benefited from lower inventory charges. As noted last quarter, both the fourth quarter of fiscal 2024 and the first quarter of fiscal 2025 benefited from favorable component costs.
* We announced a ten-for-one forward stock split of our issued common stock to make stock ownership more accessible to employees and investors. The split will be effected through an amendment to our Restated Certificate of Incorporation, which will result in a proportionate increase in the number of shares of authorized common stock. Each record holder of common stock as of the close of market on Thursday, June 6, 2024 will receive nine additional shares of common stock, to be distributed after the close of market on Friday, June 7, 2024. Trading is expected to commence on a split-adjusted basis at market open on Monday, June 10, 2024.
* We also announced a 150% increase in our quarterly cash dividend from $0.04 per share to $0.10 per share of common stock. The increased dividend is equivalent to $0.01 per share on a post-split basis and will be paid on Friday, June 28, 2024, to all shareholders of record on Tuesday, June 11, 2024.

1185,1185,Nvidia,1440p dldsr on a 1080p monitor or upgrade to native 1440p + monitor recommendations,"Couldn't find a definitive answer online so I decided to ask here.

I currently have a 3060 ti, and a 1080p monitor, but basically run every game at 1440p either with dldsr or add dlss to it, if the GPU can't handle it. To me It looks better that native 1080p in most games, to the point I basically run nothing at native 1080p anymore.

Would it be worth it to upgrade to a native 1440p monitor?
Would the difference be significant over the dldsr upscaler.

1189,1189,Nvidia,"""Negative LOD Bias"" fully explained (fix for blurry textures)","There are many opinions regarding Negative LOD Bias floating around: some say it does nothing, many recommend setting in to ""clamp"" together with forced 16x anisotropic filtering.

For those who don't know, Negative LOD bias makes the game load higher resolution textures closer relative to the camera, resulting in crisper, sharper, higher quality textures at the cost of introducing aliasing and shimmering. 

In the past, games had full control over this ""bias"" but as 16x anisotropic filtering became the norm, gamers started complaining about shimmering from the overly sharp textures on objects such as fences and lines. 

Around 2012-ish Nvidia introduced ""driver controlled LOD bias"", a setting present in the Nvidia Profile Inspector. It was meant to take away the game's control and introduce less agressive negative bias, reducing aliasing at the cost of making all textures look muddy and blurry (oil painting games who?). It works by prioritising the driver's value over the game's built in value. 

Additionally, forcing 16x anisotropic filtering or setting ""Anisotropic Filtering quality"" to High Quality automatically clamps (removes altogether) negative bias whether it's set to Allow or Clamp in the control panel. 

Personally, i think you have a high end setup capable of running the highest quality antialiasing method in the game, such as 8xMSAA or whatever the Ultra/High/upscaling antialiasing method the game has, especially if you have a 4k setup, is enough to counter aliasing introduced by negative bias. Combined with High Quality driver forced 16x Anisotropic filtering, game-controlled negative bias makes all textures crisp and sharp, removing the ""oil painting"" effect many gamers are complaining about in modern games. 

See for yourself:
In the Nvidia Profile Inspector, change ""Driver Controlled LOD bias"" to ""off"". That's it, now every game you have from any year will look different. It doesn't matter if it's DirectX or OpenGL. Some games will look worse, others will look better. 

I tried it out with Assassin's Creed Origins, a notoriously muddy game, and i am honestly liking it very much. Other games, such as BeamNG, which has a ton of aliasing to begin with, look worse. Either way, i believe if you are seeing muddy textures on a game changing this 1 setting will fix the problem.

Edit: i forgot to add that the ""negative lod bias"" setting must be set to Allow and not to Clamp",1716390029.0,NEGATIVE,0.9962474703788757
1190,1190,Nvidia,ASUS RTX 4080 Super TUF Hot Spot caused by rock hard paste? + re-paste results,"**Context:**  
After owning the card for roughly 3 weeks I noticed the Hot Spot temp slowly increasing every time I used it for either games or rendering. In the first couple of days of owning this card the Hot Spot temp was almost never going over 80C, for me this was more than fine.

Yesterday I was playing CS2 and even though that game doesn't push my GPU usage to 100% ever, the Hot Spot temp maxed out at 91C.  
91C isn't the most horrible Hot Spot I've ever seen but it was clearly becoming a trend that the Hot Spot was increasing over time, even during gaming loads.

**Disassembly:**  
Today I took the card apart which was extremely easy, after removing the heat sink from the card I instantly noticed this dried up spot: [https://i.imgur.com/Vkv5qSJ.jpeg](https://i.imgur.com/Vkv5qSJ.jpeg)  
It was very odd seeing this dried up spot as the surrounding paste was still very much liquid.  
After cleaning the GPU die, I couldn't get rid of that little dried up spot, even with isopropyl alcohol it would not go away.  
After using a plastic scraping tool I managed to get it off and clean the GPU die completely.

**Re-paste result:**  
So for re-pasting I used Thermal Grizzly Kryonaut and I spread the paste with the included plastic spatula.  
Before and after: [https://i.imgur.com/9gqhLDo.png](https://i.imgur.com/9gqhLDo.png) (ASUS stock paste on top and TGK paste on bottom).  
Room temp was around 25C\~.   
I used Fire Strike Ultra on a loop for the test, First I let the PC idle for about 5min.  
With stock paste I ran the test for 10min, after re-paste I ran the test for 20min just to make sure it was all good, so it's not a completely 1:1 test.

**ASUS RTX 4080 SUPER TUF, +150 on the core, +750 on the memory, 110% PL, Stock fan curve.**

Please let me know your thought on what happened here because I never seen thermal paste this hard/dried up.  
This also makes me wonder if this is a thermal paste problem or a design problem.   
Thermal paste could definitely be higher quality in my opinion.  
If this is a design flaw then I guess I will find out over time as the thermal paste gets older, if my temps become way higher/worse again I will edit this post with an update.",1716384727.0,NEGATIVE,0.9994927644729614

1. I bought a **""self-paced course""** before going to bed one day. I opened the course to see the content, left my computer on, and when I actually sat down to do the course, I found a message saying, ""You have exhausted the lab time provided with your course enrollment.""
2. **Before** buying the course, I specifically narrowed down the search to pick a course with a certification. However, Nvidia support now tells me that this course has no certification, despite it still showing on their website as having one. See the attached image.
3. Course completion: I have completed the course, but the progress page shows 75% completion, a grade score of ""zero,"" and a certification status saying, ""in order to qualify for a certificate, you must have a passing grade.""

Nvidia support acknowledged the 75% completion bug but refuses to issue a certification. So, I have paid for a course where I can't log in on my own time to re-watch videos, can't get a certification, and can't prove or display course completion. This is extremely disappointing, as I see these issues happening to others as well.

I have asked for a refund or credit toward another course. Let's see what happens.

Are all ""self-paced courses"" limited in that you have to complete them within a certain time frame?

Couldn't get it working with an older build of edge unfortunately (which was a pain to install) so I thought I would experiment with the newly added feature on firefox and to my suprise, Vsr was active and working on drm content (Netflix and Crunchroll). Had a look on here and no-one has mentioned this so I thought I would.

One thing is that netflix doesn't have 1080p on firefox, but a quick duckduck search and there's an addon for that! Its called netflux!

To set it up: 

go to about:config on firefox and the flag to check is:  ""gfx.webrender.overlay-vp-super-resolution""

Having Issues with your driver? Read here!

**Before you start - Make sure you Submit Feedback for your Nvidia Driver Issue**

There is only one real way for any of these problems to get solved, and that’s if the Driver Team at Nvidia knows what those problems are. So in order for them to know what’s going on it would be good for any users who are having problems with the drivers to [Submit Feedback](https://forms.gle/kJ9Bqcaicvjb82SdA) to Nvidia. A guide to the information that is needed to submit feedback can be found [here](http://nvidia.custhelp.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/3141).

**Additionally, if you see someone having the same issue you are having in this thread, reply and mention you are having the same issue. The more people that are affected by a particular bug, the higher the priority that bug will receive from NVIDIA!!**

**Common Troubleshooting Steps**

* Be sure you are on the latest build of Windows 10 or 11
* Please visit the following link for [DDU guide](https://goo.gl/JChbVf) which contains full detailed information on how to do Fresh Driver Install.
* If your driver still crashes after DDU reinstall, try going to Go to Nvidia Control Panel -> Managed 3D Settings -> Power Management Mode: Prefer Maximum Performance

If it still crashes, we have a few other troubleshooting steps but this is fairly involved and you should not do it if you do not feel comfortable. Proceed below at your own risk:

* A lot of driver crashing is caused by Windows TDR issue. There is a huge post on GeForce forum about this [here](https://forums.geforce.com/default/topic/413110/the-nvlddmkm-error-what-is-it-an-fyi-for-those-seeing-this-issue/). This post dated back to 2009 (Thanks Microsoft) and it can affect both Nvidia and AMD cards.
* Unfortunately this issue can be caused by many different things so it’s difficult to pin down. However, editing the [windows registry](https://www.reddit.com/r/battlefield_4/comments/1xzzn4/tdrdelay_10_fixed_my_crashes_since_last_patch/) might solve the problem.
* Additionally, there is also a tool made by Wagnard (maker of DDU) that can be used to change this TDR value. [Download here](http://www.wagnardmobile.com/Tdr%20Manipulator/Tdr%20Manipulator%20v1.1.zip). Note that I have not personally tested this tool.

If you are still having issue at this point, visit [GeForce Forum for support](https://forums.geforce.com/default/board/33/geforce-drivers/) or contact your manufacturer for RMA.

**Common Questions**

* **Is it safe to upgrade to <insert driver version here>?** *Fact of the matter is that the result will differ person by person due to different configurations. The only way to know is to try it yourself. My rule of thumb is to wait a few days. If there’s no confirmed widespread issue, I would try the new driver.*

**Bear in mind that people who have no issues tend to not post on Reddit or forums. Unless there is significant coverage about specific driver issue, chances are they are fine. Try it yourself and you can always DDU and reinstall old driver if needed.**

* **My color is washed out after upgrading/installing driver. Help!** *Try going to the Nvidia Control Panel -> Change Resolution -> Scroll all the way down -> Output Dynamic Range = FULL.*
* **My game is stuttering when processing physics calculation** *Try going to the Nvidia Control Panel and to the Surround and PhysX settings and ensure the PhysX processor is set to your GPU*
* **What does the new Power Management option “Optimal Power” means? How does this differ from Adaptive?** *The new power management mode is related to what was said in the Geforce GTX 1080 keynote video. To further reduce power consumption while the computer is idle and nothing is changing on the screen, the driver will not make the GPU render a new frame; the driver will get the one (already rendered) frame from the framebuffer and output directly to monitor.*

Remember, driver codes are extremely complex and there are billions of different possible configurations. The software will not be perfect and there will be issues for some people. For a more comprehensive list of open issues, please take a look at the Release Notes. Again, I encourage folks who installed the driver to post their experience here... good or bad.

*Did you know NVIDIA has a Developer Program with 150+ free SDKs, state-of-the-art Deep Learning courses, certification, and access to expert help. Sound interesting?* [Learn more here](https://nvda.ws/3wCfH6X)*.*",1716302432.0,NEGATIVE,0.942283034324646

I currently have a couple years old rig with 5800X3D (I play rimworld a lot and it loads it fast as it’s good on single core) 64GB RAM and Galax HOF 3080ti 

Currently stationed in Australia, so prices are a bit whack.


My 3080ti is out of stock except online where it’s ~$2,400-$3,000 AUD, and used listings selling for similar.
I could sell it to cover the cost of a new GPU if needed.


I play on 3440x1440p resolution, and the most intensive game would be CP2077, which in heavy areas with RT off can dip to early 40s briefly. Otherwise it will hold ~80-90fps easily. From what I’ve read and heard, the NVIDIA frame generation can help massively with this, but I don’t know if that’s just marketing.


I’ve seen that online reviews show the 4070ti super and 4080 super performing much better than 3080ti at 4K, which is higher pixel density than my current resolution.



Has anyone had experience with the current gen on this resolution vs the 3080ti?

Coming from a AMD6900XT ( which was liquid cooled by the way ) , I got fedup with the AMD drivers and switch to Nvidia , got myself a new 4090.

I play a little bit of VR games too. I have always had disabled the ray tracing and shadows etc for optimization, but it's a feature i want to try out later.

Reason for upgrade is because I'm playing new games like alan wake 2 that are very demanding (upscaled from 2560x1440 to 3440), like the forest areas 35-45 fps, dark place 60-75. BF2042 100 fps for comparison. But i play all types of singleplayer games now that are in my backlog.

- 3D modelling (blender), rendering (blender & Unreal Engine 5) and compositing inside of Photoshop with some video editing 

- Casual gaming, don't play often and never really try to play at these crazy ultra high settings on high-end games. 

  
- Browsing YouTube and other socials 

  
Considering those things, it doesn't seem like it would be entirely worth it to jump to a 4090 for a nominal increase when the 3090 can do similar things. Importantly, for my main priority which is modelling/rendering VRAM capacity is key and both cards are equal in that regard, and combined with the fact that the 4090 is more expensive and also doesn't serve my needs anymore than the 3090 it seems reasonable to opt for the cheaper 3090 card, save some money to be spent on other components/monitors. 

  
I often see people talk about these cards mainly from the perspective of gaming, but for my modelling/rendering purposes I see myself gaining enormously from the 3090 gain and being satisfied with its performance capacity for projects long term much more cheaply than the 4090. My company uses an RTX A2000 and it handles programmes like Lumion really well at a demanding level with 12GB of VRAM, I can only imagine what the 3090 could do.

1277,1277,Nvidia,Help with upgrading ,"Hello there Redditor’s, 

I have questions regarding upgrading my desktop PC. 

My current spec is:
Intel Core i5 8400 @ 2.80GHz Coffee Lake 
16.0 RAM dual channel
ASUS Prime H310-PLUS R2.0 motherboard
NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1060 6GB
SSD and HDD for storage. 
Kolink Core series 600W PSU

I would like to upgrade the GPU only at this time preferably as I’m strapped for monies. Can my current specifications handle a RTX 2060 super and RTX 2070 super either one obviously not both 😅? 

Secondly, were would be the best place to buy older released GPUs? 

Thirdly, Would I need extra components to install these? 

Finally, are there anyone on this channel that had similar set ups mentioned above and have upgraded? 

Looking forward for advices and suggestions 

Thank you. 🙏🏾 🙏🏾🙏🏾",1715972099.0,POSITIVE,0.9426741003990173

I'm currently running a 5800x3D (new cpu) on an 8 year old mobo and PSU.

I am looking to upgrade some components to get better performance but I'm in a bit of a bind and im looking for advice.

With my current setup I don't know if I can actually fit a 4080 inside of my case. If I could I would more than likely buy one.

I'm faced with the choice of upgrading to a 4070 or 4070 ti (size permitting) and just keeping my current setup.

Or

Purchasing a 4080 and having to purchase a new case (and more than likely PSU just because I'll be rebuilding my current setup anyways).

I have a 4K 144hz display so I would like to get the most out of that. I also stream and record videos for youtube occasionally as well.

So my question for you folks do I settle for a 4070 for now, or upgrade the necessary parts to fit a 4080.. or do I wait until next gen with it being around the corner. 

I do have money in hand but I would like to get the most out of my purchase over the next 4-5 years. To put it into perspective a 4080 is still 1300-1500+ tax CAD which is fairly steep for a graphics card these days.

Because some of these conda environments are quite valuable in what they do from a research point of view it's not easy to ""just use the latest torch"" as requirements for the environment will lock you in to a number of packages (sometimes a lot) at specific versions - so, for example, numpy needs to be an older version f

So a basic questions is there a CUDA utility that let's one conveniently manage multiple versions from say a command line? I'm very UNIX savvy and currently have an AWS EC2 instance with cuda 12.1 and it's working fine but I now have a conda environment from a research paper that requires 11.1. I did in fact try to run the environment and test code but it bombed. 

Im also savvy about gcc and recompiling things, setting CPATHS, LD\_LIBRARY\_PATHs etc so that's not a problem but would be nice if there was some tool that helped with this. 

I was able to get Theano to work on the EC2 instance which took quite a trick, hacking on the YAML environment file. I know - why use Theano? Because we are trying to reproduce a published result using another researcher's environment from several years ago. Anyway, thanks for input",1715711981.0,NEGATIVE,0.9941779375076294

Overall, I've absolutely loved it and performance has been amazing.

# System:

***RTX 4080 SUPER / Ryzen 7 7800X3D / 32GB DDR5 6000 CL30 / 2TB / 750W***

# Legend:

* **4K 60 Unlocked**: No frame rate cap is applied, game achieves over 60fps at all times, in the case of Cyberpunk 2077 this means 75-95fps, and in Alan Wake II this means 80-100fps
* **1440p 240 ""VRR"" or 4K 120 ""VRR""**: The game does not consistently hit the max refresh rate of the monitor, but its close enough that I prefer to run it uncapped, and let VRR handle the drops. For me to call it ""1440p 240 VRR"" That would mean the average FPS is within 180-240fps on a 240hz panel. Likewise, 100-120fps would count to me as ""4K 120 VRR""
* **If ""Unlocked"" or ""VRR"" is not specified**, the target frame rate is achieved 100% of the time.

Keep in mind, many, if not all of the games I'm running at 1440p 120hz can run at much higher frame rates than that. I choose to cap my framerate in single player games because I prefer consistent frame pacing. I'm using a small form factor build so it helps keep down on noise and temps too.

Likewise, all of the ""4K 60"" games run 4K 80-90fps, but its not quite 4K 120, or what I consider 4K 120 VRR territory, so I cap them at 60 for the same reason as above, plus I don't mind 60fps in single player games on controller.

Obviously, there are plenty of benchmarks online, but if any of you are considering a 4080 or 4080 Super for a 1440p 240hz or 4k 120hz panel, I hope this guide helps you out!

I’m new to the PC gaming community and have recently built a PC with the latest RTX 4090.  
My monitor supports 4K resolution at 144Hz, but most of my games are running at 160-180+ FPS.

I’m wondering what adjustments I can make in the NVIDIA Control Panel to achieve the highest image quality considering that I use 4k for games (mostly first-person shooting so FPS is important, but 4090 is outperforming for most of my games).

I’d like to limit the performance to 144Hz so that the graphics card can utilize any additional resources to enhance image quality rather than pushing FPS beyond 144 which has zero benefits due to monitor limits.  
Are there any articles that summarize the right settings and balance to have?

1. should I use Image Scaling in NVidia Control Panel (NVCP) or not? I understand it's beneficial if you are playing below native monitor resolution. But what if you are using the native one? What setting to use then

I have RTX HDR turned on for a certain game in the ""Program Settings"" tab (lets say Red Faction), I open said game and it works properly. Problem is now RTX HDR gets flipped to On for the Global Settings when doing this, now if I go into another game that has native HDR support it will have RTX HDR enabled AND Native HDR so I need to always remember to open the Nvidia app and turn RTX OFF in global settings. This causes another issue though, I just went to play Indika (which I had RTX HDR enabled for) but I couldn't seem to get it working, and after I realized I had to turn RTX HDR to ""On"" in the global settings it started working again. 

Is anyone else having weird issues with RTX HDR and the Nvidia app similar to this? If its just because the App is in beta and its a know issue I get it. But if its something I can fix by doing this or that I would love to know. Thanks",1715549337.0,NEGATIVE,0.9868828654289246

I got a 3080 that fit in it, physically the only one that would fit, and I had to under-clock it so it would fit in the power/heat constraints of the case.  I gave up, built a mid-tower PC, and use that for gaming.

I want to turn my NUC11BTMi9 into a strickly OBS machine and want to get the smallest/coolest card that can handle NVIDIA RTX Voice.

The card that's in it, the EVGA XC3 Ultra 3080, is the largest card that will fit in it.  In fact it would go in a lot easier if it was 2mm shorter, that are the dimensions I'm dealing with.

The Length of the EVGA XC3 Ultra is 11.23 in or 285.37mm but if my memory is correct this was a lie, I think it is like 2mm longer.  I think the case can hold a card that is 287 and this card barely fits.  So anyway, a card shorter than 285.

1374,1374,Nvidia,PSA about RTSS's Reflex mode (you might be greatly increasing your latency!),"I think some people are increasing their latency due to confusion about the new Reflex low latency mode in RTSS (software that MSI Afterburner uses). It has to do with how the Reflex setting in a game automatically limits the framerate for you, but the Reflex mode in RTSS evidently doesn't.

For reasons explained by blurbusters in [this article](https://blurbusters.com/gsync/gsync101-input-lag-tests-and-settings/), the lowest latency way to play without screen tearing is to limit your framerate just below your monitor's max refresh rate (e.g., 58 fps on a 60 hz monitor or 117 fps on a 120 hz monitor), then turn on gsync and vsync in the Nvidia app (or control panel). This framerate limiting can have a major reduction in latency (see the graphs on page 5 in the above blurbusters article). This is relevant to Nvidia Reflex because it automatically does this framerate limiting for you when you turn that setting on in game (or turn on DLSS frame generation, which uses Reflex). For this reason, it's recommended to turn off other framerate limiters when turning on Reflex (or DLSS frame generation).

This brings me to the new Reflex mode in RTSS that was added in version 7.3.5. It evidently does **not** automatically limit your framerate just below your monitor's refresh rate. Unlike Reflex low latency mode in a game's settings, you need to set a hard fps limit to get it to do this. If you're not doing this because you think it should work like Reflex when enabled in a game's settings, you may be greatly increasing your latency.

I recently tested this in Returnal on my 120 hz monitor on a gpu (4090) that doesn't have a problem hitting 120+ fps in that game with frame generation and ray tracing off, and DLSS set to quality. Using the overlay that comes with the Nvidia app to measure latency, I tested 3 scenarios (all with gsync and vsync enabled in the Nvidia app, and with RTSS set to use Reflex rather than the previous asych setting):

- In-game Reflex setting on, RTSS framerate limiter off (set to 0): I got ~117 fps output, and Nvidia's overlay reported **~18-20 ms latency**.

- In-game Reflex setting off, RTSS framerate limiter off (set to 0): I got 120 fps output, and Nvidia's overlay reported **~50 ms latency!**

- In-game Reflex setting off, RTSS framerate limiter set to 177: I got 117 fps output, and Nvidia's overlay reported **~20 ms latency**.

That's **~30 ms of added latency** from not capping framerate, which I suspect that many people have been doing due to confusion since this new Reflex mode has been added. This new mode is cool. It is compatible with DLSS frame generation, which may be useful if you want to further limit your framerate to reduce power draw or to give you more CPU headroom (which I suspect could lessen certain CPU related stutter). However, it evidently won't automatically limit the framerate for you.

Plus, being on RTSS 7.3.5 or later does not automatically enable Reflex, which is currently not the default (async is). You have to go in the settings to enable it, which most people probably haven't done.",1715432438.0,NEGATIVE,0.9850849509239197

1393,1393,Nvidia,Is it too late/early to upgrade to an RTX 40xx now?,"I apologize if this does not fit to this sub but i think it does, it is a question a lot of people have in mind;

is it too late/early to upgrade to a 40x0 (for my case 4090)??

Let me elaborate;

We all know the rumors that RTX 5090 will be launched in a few months. As a person who was an Apple Advisor for 5 years i always told anyone, any customer not to buy any LATEST model iphone after July/August if they want to most out of their phones with cheapest price. I also told anyone who is going to earlier models to not buy either, because whenever a new model is released, older models (exceptions are there) will get cheaper.

So my concerns are;

I'll get 4090 for a premium price (2000$ is the one i am thinking and it is the cheapest 4090 in my country, Galax SG. The next one is about 2700$) and it will be ""obsolete"" in a few months.

I'll get the ""most powerful"" gpu but in a few months a double performance one will be released.

To this day i still read about faulty psu connections (my psu is also an older model and does not have the new socket, i have to use 6-8 pins)

I won't get it for this price but with 5090s price might not change so all i would have managed to do is postponing the purchase. I may not afford 5090 anyways

Please comment, i am really on the fence about getting it but.... well i am on the fence :D

1399,1399,Nvidia,The quality of the RMA process since EVGA has ceased production of graphics cards...,"--TLDR at the end.--

# Card #1

* This is my original graphics card, an EVGA 3080ti XC3 ULTRA GAMING edition ordered during the height of pandemic pricing at £1399.99 from CCL.

I had no issues with this card whatsoever, then I got a brand new TV I wanted to hook up to my PC, I had to connect this via HDMI as TVs just don't have displayport ports (*yet?*). Prior to this I have never even used the HDMI port on my GPU, only two displayport ports for two monitors.

When I connected the TV and played any HDR 4K 120hz content (*The absolute limit of HDMI, only possible with a HDMI 2.1 certified cable*) I would get random screen blackouts and colour issues, this did not occur on anything other than HDR 4K 120hz content. I noticed that angling the HDMI cable at the GPU end would cause the issue to go away, however gravity caused the cable to sag again and the issues recurred. This lead me to believe that the connection was not perfect, and flaws appear when every byte of data matters.

I tried many different displays and many different 2.1 HDMI cables, all with the same result. I figured my card is still under warranty and I should be able to use the HDMI port without these issues so proceeded to open an advanced RMA (*the difference between a regular and advanced RMA is you have to put down the entire cost of purchase as collatoral, then a new product will be sent out before the company receives the original, reducing downtime*).

# Card #2 (Two weeks from deposit to delivery)

* After an advanced RMA (with a deposit of \~1200 euros that was based on purchase price) I received a new EVGA 3080ti XC3 ULTRA GAMING (*the exact same model as my original*).

All was well with this new card and the HDMI issues were no longer pressent... for about 2 days, after that I woke up one morning to my PC not POSTing with the white ""VGA"" light appearing on my motherboard, indicating a GPU issue.

I tried this card with different PCIE cables, I tried reseating the RAM, CPU and repluging everything on the motherboard itself, I tried resetting the CMOS, different ports, nothing. I plop in my old and battle-hardened MSI GTX 970 and the system roars to life without issues. At this point I suspect the card itself is DOA, so I ask my boyfriend if I can use his PC to see if it will boot, it does not. The exact same issue happens in his machine.

So now knowing that I have a dead card, I place another advanced RMA (*even though this card is dead, I didn't want to be without a PC whilst they waited on the return*).

It was at this point I discovered that EVGA will only send out refurbished models, not brand new ones; this makes sense as they do not produce these cards any more.

They sent me an email stating that they no longer have the EVGA 3080ti XC3 ULTRA GAMING edition in stock, so instead they can offer me a EVGA 3080ti FTW3 ULTRA GAMING edition, I accept.

# Card #3 (One week from deposit to delivery)

* The EVGA 3080ti FTW3 ULTRA GAMING edition I received worked totally perfectly... for a grand total of 8 days.

I only really did light gaming during the first 7 days, (*Mortal Kombat / Binding of Isaac*) and everything seemed to go swimmingly. After this point I started playing more demanding games (*Elden Ring / Baldurs Gate 3*) and noticed my PC was randomly black screening with a hard crash after an hour or so: non-responsive keyboard LEDs, ctrl+alt+del did nothing etc. I hit up the event viewer to see what error happens at the point of crash:

    The description for Event ID 0 from source nvlddmkm cannot be found. Either the component that raises this event is not installed on your local computer or the installation is corrupted. You can install or repair the component on the local computer.
    
    If the event originated on another computer, the display information had to be saved with the event.
    
    The following information was included with the event: 
    
    \Device\Video8
    Error occurred on GPUID: 100
    
    The message resource is present but the message was not found in the message table

Two days of troubleshooting the same old cables, drivers, CMOS etc. (*and continuing to blackscreen*) later and I finally decide enough is enough, I'll see if it can handle itself under load by doing a stress test, I decided on downloading furmark. It is consistently blackscreening after around 10 seconds in the furmark 1440p preset.

# Today

Whilst I am troubleshooting this issue, I start recording evidence for EVGA... **Almost Immediately** after blackscreening on video at the very start of a furmark test, the machine would no longer POST and presented the exact same symptoms as **Card #2**. I am now again without a functioning GPU, and have to resort back to my good ol' MSI GTX 970 just so I can use two monitors as I quite literally need this machine for my work (*I am a Software Developer*). It boots fine with the MSI GTX 970, the ""new"" EVGA 3080ti FTW3 ULTRA GAMING edition now won't POST no matter what machine it is plugged into, identical to **Card #2** completely DOA.

I did also try additionally this time to check the ""OC"" profile on the GPU PCB and the results were still the same, ruling out a firmware issue.

Now here I am, today, May 10th, ranting on Reddit about this whole situation.

# Extra

During the original RMA process, my original card got completely totalled by UPS, I packed it exactly the same way **Card #2** was sent to me, same box, same packaging material, even same courier.

Thankfully EVGA are bros and accepted the RMA anyway, but it does mean I can't be sent back my original card with the HDMI issue and just deal with it. So I am shit out of luck and now have to deal with EVGA's atrocious RMA QC. At least I know I am not alone after reading so many threads of people in the exact same situation.

I just hope they can at least refund current market value of the card \~£500-£600 so I can go purchase an identical one from a local store and not have to deal with this any more.

# TLDR:

EVGA are still mad bros with great customer service. However the RMA refurbishment QC is severely lacking with no sight of getting better due to an ever dwindling supply.",1715303067.0,NEGATIVE,0.9535697102546692

Having Issues with your driver? Read here!

**Before you start - Make sure you Submit Feedback for your Nvidia Driver Issue**

There is only one real way for any of these problems to get solved, and that’s if the Driver Team at Nvidia knows what those problems are. So in order for them to know what’s going on it would be good for any users who are having problems with the drivers to [Submit Feedback](https://forms.gle/kJ9Bqcaicvjb82SdA) to Nvidia. A guide to the information that is needed to submit feedback can be found [here](http://nvidia.custhelp.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/3141).

**Additionally, if you see someone having the same issue you are having in this thread, reply and mention you are having the same issue. The more people that are affected by a particular bug, the higher the priority that bug will receive from NVIDIA!!**

**Common Troubleshooting Steps**

* Be sure you are on the latest build of Windows 10 or 11
* Please visit the following link for [DDU guide](https://goo.gl/JChbVf) which contains full detailed information on how to do Fresh Driver Install.
* If your driver still crashes after DDU reinstall, try going to Go to Nvidia Control Panel -> Managed 3D Settings -> Power Management Mode: Prefer Maximum Performance

If it still crashes, we have a few other troubleshooting steps but this is fairly involved and you should not do it if you do not feel comfortable. Proceed below at your own risk:

* A lot of driver crashing is caused by Windows TDR issue. There is a huge post on GeForce forum about this [here](https://forums.geforce.com/default/topic/413110/the-nvlddmkm-error-what-is-it-an-fyi-for-those-seeing-this-issue/). This post dated back to 2009 (Thanks Microsoft) and it can affect both Nvidia and AMD cards.
* Unfortunately this issue can be caused by many different things so it’s difficult to pin down. However, editing the [windows registry](https://www.reddit.com/r/battlefield_4/comments/1xzzn4/tdrdelay_10_fixed_my_crashes_since_last_patch/) might solve the problem.
* Additionally, there is also a tool made by Wagnard (maker of DDU) that can be used to change this TDR value. [Download here](http://www.wagnardmobile.com/Tdr%20Manipulator/Tdr%20Manipulator%20v1.1.zip). Note that I have not personally tested this tool.

If you are still having issue at this point, visit [GeForce Forum for support](https://forums.geforce.com/default/board/33/geforce-drivers/) or contact your manufacturer for RMA.

**Common Questions**

* **Is it safe to upgrade to <insert driver version here>?** *Fact of the matter is that the result will differ person by person due to different configurations. The only way to know is to try it yourself. My rule of thumb is to wait a few days. If there’s no confirmed widespread issue, I would try the new driver.*

**Bear in mind that people who have no issues tend to not post on Reddit or forums. Unless there is significant coverage about specific driver issue, chances are they are fine. Try it yourself and you can always DDU and reinstall old driver if needed.**

* **My color is washed out after upgrading/installing driver. Help!** *Try going to the Nvidia Control Panel -> Change Resolution -> Scroll all the way down -> Output Dynamic Range = FULL.*
* **My game is stuttering when processing physics calculation** *Try going to the Nvidia Control Panel and to the Surround and PhysX settings and ensure the PhysX processor is set to your GPU*
* **What does the new Power Management option “Optimal Power” means? How does this differ from Adaptive?** *The new power management mode is related to what was said in the Geforce GTX 1080 keynote video. To further reduce power consumption while the computer is idle and nothing is changing on the screen, the driver will not make the GPU render a new frame; the driver will get the one (already rendered) frame from the framebuffer and output directly to monitor.*

Remember, driver codes are extremely complex and there are billions of different possible configurations. The software will not be perfect and there will be issues for some people. For a more comprehensive list of open issues, please take a look at the Release Notes. Again, I encourage folks who installed the driver to post their experience here... good or bad.

1412,1412,Nvidia,Experience Ghost of Tsushima: Director’s Cut with DLSS 3 & Reflex,"From GeForce PR:

Every week, NVIDIA brings you the latest updates in gaming tech. This week it’s all about our GeForce Game Ready Driver for *Ghost of Tsushima: Director’s Cut*, enhanced with DLSS 3, DLAA, and Reflex. 

*Ghost of Tsushima* brings players to the late 1200s, when the Mongol Empire ruled across many of today’s Eastern nations. Tsushima Island is all that stands between mainland Japan and a massive Mongol invasion by General Khotun Khan.

The island has become an inferno caused by the initial Mongol attack. It is then that the Samurai Warrior Jin Sakai’s steadfastness is tested. As one of the remaining members of his clan, Jin has to do whatever it takes to defend his people and home. He is forced to forgo tradition and take on the Ghost path, using unprecedented techniques for that time  in order to free Tsushima. 

The Director’s Cut of *Ghost of Tsushima* is the first time players can embark, on PC, on the journey Jin faced. 

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EzWBNwhb870](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EzWBNwhb870) 

May 16th will mark the launch of [*Ghost of Tsushima: Director’s Cut*](https://store.steampowered.com/app/2215430/Ghost_of_Tsushima_DIRECTORS_CUT/). This launch will include out-of-the-box support for our unparalleled game-enhancing tech. DLSS 2 and DLSS 3 will allow players to accelerate frame rates, allowing for the fastest performance yet! Gamers also can utilize DLAA which uses a native resolution image to maximize image quality, rather than boost performance. This release will allow players to combine DLAA and DLSS 3 for excellent image quality and performance. 

It only gets more exciting from here, because gamers can also use [NVIDIA Reflex](https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/geforce/technologies/reflex/), which can be implemented with any of the settings on GeForce RTX and GeForce GTX GPUs. This will reduce [system latency](https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/geforce/guides/system-latency-optimization-guide/) making actions quicker while giving a competitive edge in multiplayer matches,  all while making single-player games more responsive and fun to play. 

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cXg7GQogAE](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cXg7GQogAE) 

Since September 2020, NVIDIA Reflex has reduced latency on GeForce GPUs and is now available in more than 100 games. 9 out of 10 shooters now feature Reflex support as well as critically acclaimed multi and single player games. A majority of GeForce Gamers have enabled the feature - last year GeForce users played more than 10 billion hours of their favorite titles featuring increased responsiveness all due to Reflex. 

Download and install our new Game Ready Driver before the *Ghost of Tsushima: Director’s Cut* is released May 16 and you’ll be able to bring out this game’s full potential!

I ordered a used gpu off eBay and it was broken, no output no display nothing.

Waited one week, and a package arrives. It is too big to be a gpu, but to my surprise when I open it it is not a gpu, but 7. 

3 gigabyte 3070s, 2 ev3a 3070s, a tuff 3070 and a founders edition 3060ti.

I now have 8 gpus, one broken, and they are not asking for any back.

Unfortunately for me, almost all of these have been in the mines until near death. Most of them output and work fine until they are out under any sort of stress; if they’re stressed their temps skyrocket (thermal paste?) and the system shuts down to avoid overheating.

My original plan was to upgrade my CPU to the 7800x3d (this would mean MB and RAM upgrades too) and then eventually upgrade to a 4080 SUPER or possibly the upcoming 5000 series GPU's (pcie 5).

I have a 1440p ultrawide monitor at 100 hz and my secondary monitor is also a 1440p at 144 hz (I use the ultrawide mainly because it's more convenient for me). I run all my games on max settings (if able to) and I try to turn on ray tracing whenever I get the chance. 

With this in mind, I recently had a thought that maybe I should upgrade my GPU first to the 4080 SUPER and wait it out for the AMD 9000 series chips and upgrade to that. 

My only concern is the bottlenecking I would get as a result with pairing a 3900x to a 4080 SUPER. 

Which plan should I go for?

The main use is going to be editing, so gonna get the best CPU, but since I'm not gonna play a lot of games stuff, I wasn't sure if 4070 or 4070 ti is enough. Heard a lot of people to rather go 4080 if I have the budget as it will last 5+ years, but not sure if that money will be worth it.

1461,1461,Nvidia,4070 Ti Super and 4k,"So, I bought a brand new 4070 Ti Super a couple of months ago thinking a 4080 Super wasn't worth the extra money as I only game at 1440p, seemed like this was more than enough. Well fast forward a couple months and I am having some serious buyer's remorse as I am now getting one of the new 4k OLED panels. Saw one on a friend's setup and fell in love. 

The monitor is back ordered so I don't have it in yet but now I'm wondering if my 4070 Ti Super can handle 4k at a decent framerate. Wish I could go back and get the 4080 Super but I am well outside the return window on my 4070 and looking at the resale price is not pretty. I now know how people feel about cars that lose a ton of value as soon as you drive it off the lot. 

Anyway, point being: does anyone here have experience running at 4k with a 4070 Ti Super? How is it? Do you get decent framerates? Should I bite the bullet and trade in my 4070 before the value goes down even more? For reference I'd be spending around another $550 for a new 4080 Super unless I can somehow talk Microcenter into giving me a better deal since I just bought the card from them.

ram: 64gb

board: PRIME Z390-A (follow up question, would one of these even fit? with the three fans) 

  
normally I'd go with the 3060 but since both are similar in price, just very confused about the 8GB vs 12GB difference and which one would be better for me specifically because I use my PC for streaming and editing videos etc. so this is where my confusion comes from because I don't know which one would be better for the things I specifically do with my PC. And I need the upgrade to last without having to need to upgrade any time soon and my budget is around 300€ which both of them cost more or less.

*16GB (2x8GB) DDR4 PC4-28800C16 3600MHz Dual Channel*  
*Kolink Enclave 700W 80 Plus Gold Modular Power Supply*

*I have 2 screen: 1 x 4K 144hz and 1 x 2K 165hz*

1499,1499,Nvidia,Putting Chat With RTX To The Test (Result: It Is Promising But Not Great),"I wanted to love Chat With RTX, but my experience with the new version of ChatRTX released a few days ago was unfortunately not great.

I've written and published 25 novels at present. As I'm working on book 26 now, a sequel to Symphony of War, there's a lot to keep track of. J.K. Rowling said she used Pottermore when writing the later books to make sure she got the details right, and I wanted to do something similar; plug my book library into ChatRTX so I could ask it simple questions. Things like, ""What colour was this character's eyes?"", ""What religion is this character?"", ""Which characters were on the drop mission in Act 2?"", ""how did Riverby die?"", etc.

I also had more grandiose plans, like asking it about plot threads I hadn't resolved or anything that I might have missed in terms of plot holes or anything... or even higher-level questions. But it never got past this first stage.

The install went fine, and to test it I pointed it to a single novel, just so it didn't get confused. I also only have a 3060ti with 8gb of vRAM, so I didn't want to stress it. With this in mind, I plugged in a single novel, ""Symphony of War"".

Unfortunately, the LLM couldn't answer even basic questions about the plot, story structure, or events therein. 

Issues I observed:

- Incorrect information and vivid hallucinations

Asking simple questions like, ""What can you tell me about Marcus?"" [gave almost entirely wrong answers](https://imgur.com/vvJcXJn). He's not captured by the Myriad, he's not trying to form an alliance with them, his rock isn't magical. He IS afraid of seeming crazy because of the music in his head, but this is not related to the rock at all. The hatchery, takes place in Act 1 and is just one scene in the entire novel. And as for the fire breathing bit... that seems to be a straight-up hallucination.

I asked it why it thought there was fire-breathing, and it backtracked. It was correctly able to determine that the broodmothers had turned on each other and were dead, but it appeared to have hallucinated the detail about fire-breathing.

[In later questions, it was able to provide some right answers](https://imgur.com/7lSrVYo) (it correctly identified Beaumont used a flamethrower and Riverby used a sniper rifle), but it said that Stanford died after being stabbed by Rabbit, whereas Stanford was in fact squished by a massive falling bit of metal. It similarly said Riverby died by being electrocuted, but she survived that and died much later being torn to pieces by bugs. It correctly identified how Rali died though.

[Weirdly, I asked it how Marcus died.](https://imgur.com/HHOOj36) He survived the book, but the LLM it hallucinated that he was ""shot by a bug"" (in the book, *he* shoots the bug) and then despite being dead, Marcus ran until he was killed by the pilot light on Beaumont's flamethrower. Beaumont too survives, but when I asked the LLM how she died, it told me Marcus shot her in the head which it seemed to pull from thin air. I asked it how Wren, who also survived the book, died and it said it was ""not clear"".

It said Beaumont and Riverby, both women, were men. I asked it how many female characters there were and it said none, despite there being many (Rali, Wren, Beaumont, Riverby, Felicity).

It correctly told me how many men were in a standard squad.

- Confusing different characters

Sometimes the chat would get confused as to who the main character was, occasionally identifying Blondie as the main character. It also got confused and thought Marcus was an agent of Internal Security, whereas he was actually *afraid* of Internal Security and accused Blondie of being a member of IS.

It seemed to get the Lost and the Myriad, two different species, confused and assigned qualities of each to the other interchangeably.

In something that surprised me, it was quite good at identifying the beliefs of various characters. [It guessed that Beaumont was an atheist despite her never saying so, and pulled up quotes of hers to support that position](https://imgur.com/w7pGao6). It correctly identified that Blondie was sceptical of religion, Rabbit was an atheist, and Riverby's religion was not mentioned. It correctly stated Riverby was a monogamist who valued duty and honour. It was similarly excellent at describing the personality of characters, noting that Beaumont's attitude suggested she had a history of being mistreated, which is quite a complex analysis.

- Profound inability to make lists or understand sequences

[If I asked it, ""What was Blondie's crime?"" it got that information right, but when I asked it, ""List the crimes of every character"", it got confused and said there was no information about crimes committed by characters.](https://imgur.com/9lnAw8J) It was able to identify the novel as a story though.

Asking it to ""list every named character in Symphony of War"" [produced absolute nonsense.](https://imgur.com/omxJdXV) Paragraph [after paragraph after paragraph of ""* 7!""](https://imgur.com/9B1adZD), that went on for several minutes until it eventually timed out.

It also got confused about how many pages the story had. [It claimed to only have a few pages from the novel, but it was able to pull information from the beginning, middle, and end of it. When I asked how many pages the novel had, it said it had 1.](https://imgur.com/MoSrpDx)

However, I asked it to pull up three quotes from each main character, and it was able to do it for Blondie and Beaumont, but not Rabbit or Riverby (both of whom have sufficient lines to supply three quotes). In fact, it identified one of Blondie's quotes as Riverby's, but that quote was spoken, Riverby wasn't even in the room or introduced as a character yet.

[It was unable to summarize the novel's plot, saying there was insufficient detail.](https://imgur.com/6Up8z2h)

Things I tried:

- Cutting out foreword, dedications, even chapter headings. Everything except the text. This had no effect.
- Adding more files, limiting to a short story set in the same universe, etc.
- Changing between LLMs, noting that with 8gb of vRAM I was quite limited in what I could select. Changing to ChatGLM didn't produce much better results and injected Chinese characters everywhere which didn't work too well at all so I switched back to Minstral.

Final conclusions:

The potential is here, and that's the frustrating part.

Sometimes it got things right. Sometimes it got things so right I was almost convinced I could rely on it, but sometimes it was just so wrong and so confident in being wrong that I knew it wasn't a good idea to trust it. I genuinely couldn't remember which of Riverby or Stanford was flogged, but I knew it was one of them, so I asked the LLM, and it said Riverby. But when I double-checked the novel, it was Stanford.

Obviously, some mistakes are going to happen and that's okay, but the number of errors and the profoundly serious way in which it misidentified characters, plots, stories, and all these kinds of things makes it just too unreliable for my purposes.

I was left wondering; even just having the application open consumes all available vRAM (and a smaller amount of system memory, 9gb overall combined). Could better results be achieved with more capable hardware?

[https://imgur.com/a/cmYuxR6](https://imgur.com/a/cmYuxR6)

I'm not very knowledgeable with PCs, but I believe my only real bottleneck is my GPU right now. I was going to upgrade to 1440p monitors from a 1080p setup, but a friend gave me his old Acer Predator 4K since he upgraded to the new LG OLED. So now, I'm wondering if it makes sense to build and plan around 4K, or if I'm better off all around going 1440p since cards are so pricey.

From my own research, I'm thinking I would at minimum need a 4070 Super, but probably 4070 TI Super or above would be more practical in the long run. Obviously not made of money so not looking to shell out more than I have to, but also don't want to end up needing to upgrade even sooner and spending more in the long run.

It's getting easier to find a 4090 FE for MSRP or lower which is both a good thing and also a bad sign for anyone buying now. It means there will be more and they will get cheaper. The question is how much cheaper...

I know it has been popular to dog on the price of the 4090 (or 40xx series in general) and it is undeniably expensive, but as far as gaming goes it is almost double the performance of a 3090 in Time Spy for $100 more MSRP. Also, a disturbing number of people paid well over MSRP (though mining at the time certainly helped offset the cost).

Anyway, I digress, the price is what it is. With current trends and demand for AI work, there's no way the 5090 is going to be cheaper than the 4090. The question is how much more and how much of a performance boost will it be. If you're a cynic, you might say the price to performance dollar increase will be 1:1. I seriously doubt that (don't think that's ever happened) but the closer it is to 1:1, theoretically the higher the resale value of a 4090 would be. But of course the 5090 will have other exclusive features and more VRAM.

Realistically we won't see the 5090 until next year and they will stay out of stock for months again, so the 4090 will still be valuable but it will obviously drop some.

Ultimately I know it just boils down to do you need/want it now, I just wonder if I'm missing anything. This would be an easier decision if we didn't just get a huge drop of amazing 4k OLED monitors. But maybe I really do just keep the 4070Ti and manage settings until the 5090.",1714668873.0,NEGATIVE,0.9872398972511292

1522,1522,Nvidia,GPU brands outside the 'big names',"I've been asking around on other subs about an upgrade from my 3050 to a 4060/4060Ti. 

My local pc store has 4 different 4060 cards in stock right now. 

INNO3D GeForce RTX 4060 Twin X2 OC, 8GB €395.00

KFA2 GeForce RTX 4060 2X 1-Click OC 8GB €405.00

ASUS DUAL GeForce RTX 4060 OC Graphics Card €419.00

KFA2 GeForce RTX 4060 EX White 1-Click OC 8GB €435.00

What is everyone's opinions regarding the differing brands? I understand the core GPU die is going to be the same, with the supporting components and pcb down to each manufacturer. The specs are all there or there abouts, with clock speeds within 50mhz of each other.

My 3050 is an MSI Aero ITX 8gb, and I would have always gravitated towards the big brands I know, MSI Gigabyte Asus.

The list above I would gravitate towards the Asus because I know more of them, but it's not really a good enough excuse to discard the others is it? 

Secondly, the 4060 runs between €395~€435.
The 4060Ti is $505~€609.

Is that jump in price worth the bump in performance?

Thanks everyone!

Update; 

I popped around to my local store, the guy did me a deal on an Asus 4060, €380 down from €420. 
The only AMD cards in stock were 6500xt and 7700xt. 7700 was almost €600. 
I compared the 4060 to my outgoing 3050 in gaming benchmarks and comparative specs, and since I wanted a gpu for my daughters pc anyway, it has essentially cost me €100 to upgrade (a 3050 is €280 here). 

I really do appreciate everyone's responses and opinions, and I took them all with great care. Ultimately the price was the main factor, with performance of Cuda cores in Blender, or other workstation applications for example the second most important consideration. DLSS brought up the final piece of the puzzle, as it will open up the option of 1440p later on if a dual monitor setup I'm planning works out to include them, or for something like Assetto Corsa or F1, DLSS for high frame rate 1080p.

I was searching for some UX Research data and searched ""*user research on social media platforms*"". What they instead showed me is basically ""*how social media can be used to do user research*"".

Is this where Google search stands after all the years? 4 of the top 5 results are irrelevant, and so does the AI overview. They boast about their natural language processing capabilities, and is this what search understands from ""user research on social media platforms"". This might sound very particular case but inspect yourselves if you've had a similar experience sometime. This is the major pain point for the user in Google search.

They better focus more on this side of things than bragging about AI that basically does nothing and asks you to ""eat at least one small rock per day"" to get essential minerals.

How to prevent text capitalization on every pause during voice to text,"*(Apologies in advance if this is not a Google or Google Voice Typing issue but rather Swiftkey or Samsung Voice input or Android settings or something else. The distinction between them has always greatly confused me. I have unsuccessfully googled and Redditted extensively for an answer so I apologize if it's already been addressed here. And understand, I LOVE the brilliant logic programmed into voice to text. But, that said...)*

I understand auto-capitalizing proper words like country names. But when I use voice to text (Swiftkey; Android 14(latest); Samsung Galaxy; and I THINK Google Voice Typing is in effect) I maddeningly get things like this:  
""The reason I asked is Because I keep getting Advertisements when I Buy it Online.""

This happens because of verbal pauses. If I stop and think for a second or two on my next word choice, and then I say it, it capitalizes. Look, I DO want auto capitalization after periods. I just don't want it any other time, except for actual proper words, not on common words following a slight pause.

\*\*Can I eliminate the ""pause"" recognition?\*\*

I suffer so greatly, that if I have to give up capitalization of proper words like Spain and do that manually, I would rather suffer through that than this devastating, horribly time consuming requirement to UN-capitalize words - common words, not proper ones.

1703,1703,Google,A detailed overview of Google's ridiculously bad AI Overview feature,"There's been a lot of talk about some of the funnier/more dangerous AI generated answers that the AI overview has givern (eating rocks, putting glue on pizza) but I want to focus on something else: it just doesn't work whatsoever, even when handling basic, non-dangerous information. Googling the phrase ""best basketball players from virginia"" is a perfect way to show exactly how bad this function is.  
  
First off, the AI Overview starts with ""Virginia has produced many great basketball players, including men's and women's college players, NBA players, and high school players."" So far, so good. So, who are these players?  
  
""Men's college players  
Some of the best men's basketball players from the University of Virginia include Bryant Stith, Ralph Sampson, Jeff Lamp, Buzzy Wilkinson, Wally Walker, and Curtis Staples.""  
  
Immediately, the AI pivots from players born in Virginia, to players who played at the University of Virginia. Some of these players are, in fact from Virginia, but this is completely coincidental. Jeff Lamp, Buzzy Wilkinson, and Wally Walker are not from Virginia.  
  
""NBA players  
Virginia Union University (VUU) alumni include NBA All-Star Ben Wallace, as well as Stephen Curry and Damien Lillard. Dell Curry, a shooting guard for Charlotte and other NBA teams, is also from Virginia Tech.""  
  
This is where it goes off the rails. First of all, none of these players are from Virginia, but we've crossed that bridge already. Only one of these players even went to VUU. So even if I had been asking about the best college basketball players in the state of Virginia, this still wouldn't be correct. I went to the article where Google got this information from to find this paragraph:  
  
""Before the big game, the team had a locker room meeting with some of the NBA's biggest stars. Stephen Curry, Damien Lillard, and Ben Wallace. Wallace, a four-time NBA All-Star who was named to the D1 First Team All America while at VUU, is another highly regarded Panther alumnus to whom we have dedicated our gym. They spoke to the team, offering words of encouragement and advice on how to perform at their best under pressure. ""  
  
Somehow, Google took that paragraph and assumed that all of these players attended VUU.  
  
""Women's college players  
Some say that Kitley, a 6'6"" center from Virginia Tech, is the most important player in the program's history.""  
  
Who even is that? I had to look up ""Kitley Virginia Tech"" to even find out who this was referencing. It was Elizabeth Kitley, a basketball player born in North Carolina.  
  
""High school players  
Some of the top Virginia high school girls basketball players include Kymora Johnson, Zakiya Stephenson, Kennedy Harris, and Sylvie Jackson.""  
  
For what it's worth, these players are all indeed from Virginia. So at least that's something.

So, to recap, Google gave me four categories of players, two of them were partially or mostly incorrect, one of them was so vague that I had to do another search to even find out what it meant, and one of them gave a correct answer. Fantastic.

  
TL:DR: The AI Overview is complete dogwater and makes finding even simple information overly confusing, as you now have to go through an extra step of verifying whatever it tells you, entirely defeating the time-saving purpose of even having an AI summary.

I had the option of “Keep until I delete it” and “Delete after x months”.

Not a single “Are you sure you want to select/delete this” or any sort of choice confirmation before it being locked in and deleted forever, and now all of my map data prior to February is gone. Contacted Google support as soon as I could, only to be told “Soz”

To rub salt in the wound, only after going through the ordeal and re-selecting the “Keep until I delete option”, did I get a pop up about backing up my Timeline data

I was wondering if any of you have noticed that the assistant on your pixel watch 2 has become utterly terrible lately? It is demonstrably more laggy. As well, it doens't do things which it did with ease not long ago. For instance, when I ask it to tell me the humidity, it will now return general weather results every time. Today I am now not able to launch workouts on my Fitbit (!??) Google Pixel 2. When attempting to start a workout with voice command it tells me their no apps to support working out... on my FITBIT Google Pixel 2.

  
I suspect that the issue is in Gemini integration- which has been horrible. I finally ditched Gemini on my phone and watch, have tried restarting both devices multiple times and nothing. If I could return the watch I could I am so frustrated with it lately. Does anyone have any info they can share? Has anyone else experienced this?

https://reddit.com/link/1ctg5xa/video/z77timxf8t0d1/player



**\[Personally recommended topics to search\]**

* Project Astra
* Starline

**\[Highlights\]**

1. Gemini is now supporting 2M tokens

* 2. Project Astra (cell phone real-time multimodal assistant)
* 3. Gemini Flash (cheaper and faster multimodal 1M)
* 4. Veo (video creation)
* 5. 6th generation TPU (Trillium)
* 6. PaliGemma
* 7. Gemma 2
* 8. NotebookLM (aka. Tailwind)
* 9. MusicFX, VideoFX

**\[Personal Thoughts\]**

1. Google mentioned ""Gemini"" more often than ""AI"" this time.(Sundar Pichai mentioned AI 121 times.)
2. Google is focusing on integrating Gemini Multimodality across all areas, covering both recognition and generation of video, audio, and text.
3. Increasing Gemini's token size seems aimed at detailed personalized info and integrated services. This was clear in Project Astra with real-time Gemini Pro integration and Context Caching, which saves costs and speeds up processing. - Comparing Google’s Gemini and OpenAI’s GPT: - Both have significant multimodal achievements. OpenAI leads in generative capabilities, while Google excels in token range. OpenAI has better API integration, but Google is superior in on-device integration. - OpenAI's massive model has high reasoning abilities, but Google's strategy includes:

3-1. On-device capabilities (Nano in Android OS, circle image search on Samsung phones, PaliGemma). Google’s mobile OS and partnerships give it an edge.

3-2. Workspace (Docs, Sheets, Slides, Email, Photos). Examples include organizing receipts in Drive and Sheets or Google Photos creating albums based on specific moments, showing the large model’s business applications.

3-3. As a search engine company, Google is developing technology to verify data with search engine data to prevent hallucinations, giving it a competitive edge.

4. The realtime capability of the multimodal model was surprising. I used the Project Astra demo; multimodal audio recognition was accurate and real-time, with seamless interrupt handling. The process wasn’t in sync but handled with low latency, showing significant improvements in usability for voice interfaces and multimodal models.

5. The main takeaway from this I/O was that multimodal models can be responsive enough for actual products and are currently available.

6. Examples were provided of how Gemini can integrate into Chrome, Search, Android Mobile, and Google Workspace to enhance user convenience. (""Here's an example"" was a common phrase.) Integrating these elements with multimodal capabilities could significantly change everyday life. I have a Gemini Office Hour with a Googler tomorrow, full of questions about Gemini’s multimodal latency. Until 2 PM during this event, I didn't hear keywords like TensorFlow/Jax, and there was little talk about the Cloud. Vertex AI was mentioned occasionally with Gemini, and the rest was about TPU 6th generation.

7. The core question was whether multimodal models could positively impact our lives. Even now, there are no significant use cases beyond chatbots. Who will make this a reality? This has been my interest, and at this I/O, I saw numerous examples. If Google had integrated chat and document apps, we’d spend most of our time with Gemini.

1810,1810,Google,The Irony of Google's AI: Penalizing AI-Generated Content,"Hey r/google,

I’ve been pondering the irony in how Google, a pioneer in AI technology, seems to be penalizing users for employing AI-generated content. Isn’t it a bit hypocritical for an AI-driven company to punish others for using similar technology? I'd love to hear your thoughts on this.

Google’s search algorithms are heavily AI-dependent, refining what we see online and making search experiences more efficient. At the same time, they've been known to penalize AI-generated content if it's not up to certain standards, often without clear guidelines on what makes AI content acceptable. This creates a perplexing scenario: Google champions the use of AI within its operations but restricts its application for others trying to navigate its platform.

This situation feels especially ironic considering how much Google has invested in AI. From DeepMind’s breakthroughs to Google Assistant’s interactions, AI is clearly a cornerstone of Google’s innovation. Yet, the same technology that enhances their services can apparently degrade ours, if Google deems it so.

The questions then arise: Shouldn't Google, as a leader in AI, encourage more exploration and innovative uses of AI by others? Why does it seem like they are gatekeeping the very technology they advocate for? Is this truly about maintaining quality, or is it about controlling how AI is used externally to keep the competition at bay?

Furthermore, as a blog owner deeply engaged in the tech world, these policies impact not just how I create content but also how I plan my SEO strategies. The mixed signals from Google make it challenging to utilize AI tools that could enhance productivity and creativity.

What are your experiences and opinions about this apparent double standard? Is Google justified in its policies, or is it time for the tech giant to rethink its approach to AI in the wider ecosystem?

Looking forward to a robust discussion!

I only have a screenshot of the post, but it's almost certainly slanderous, as it accuses him of doing things for which there is no proof or record.

If I had a link to the post, obviously I could just report the post, but this group is private and only allows females to join, for which I am not.

So is there any way to report a post, or contact Facebook to get this content taken down? Her son is currently in a mental hospital, for which he checked himself into because of all this and his tumultuous relationship with this girl, so the mother is worried right now, and the son is very concerned over these posts.

I don't know who sent the son the screenshots originally, for him to send to his mother and finally to me, and I don't really want to do too much digging. If the mother was willing to dig, or if the son was willing to ask the person who sent him the screenshots to report it, I probably would not even have been brought into the picture. So I'm just trying to help with the information that I have.

The last part, where it asks you to log in with your Facebook account to verify it's really you before deleting shows me the same message as the game I was having this issue with.

I'm writing to you today with a heavy heart. Our beloved El Amera Facebook page, the one we all rely on for news, announcements, and updates about our community, has been hacked by some Indian and Bangladesh hackers and is posting some truly disturbing, nudity-filled, and inappropriate content.

I know how much this page means to all of my city. It's a place where we stay connected, share information, and celebrate our neighborhood. Seeing it used for such harmful purposes is incredibly upsetting.

All our efforts to take down this page failed because the number was not high enough so that Facebook could take it down.

That's why I'm reaching out to all of you. We need to work together to get this page taken down. Please, if you haven't already, take a moment to visit the page (https://www.facebook.com/AbdMajidRajab) and click the ""Report Page"" button. Every report counts!!

1922,1922,Facebook,I always feel rushed to be the first to respond to a Facebook or other social media post.,"Hi everyone,]
So, lately, I've been following two super favorite singers of mine who I really love. They both have the best singing voices ever, at least my opinion. Now one has about 1900 followers, and the other has over 9 million.
I'm a huge victim of FOMO to a huge degree. In fact, FOMO has taken over so much of my life to the point where if I miss a post from one of these two singers, I feel like I'm toast. Now this fear of missing other people isn't that new. It's not like I started having that issue ever since following these two artists a year ago. I've always had a fear of missing stuff from my close friend Hailey ever since 2019 when I missed a HUGE exciting post from her that got tons of reactions, and guess what, she never heard my comment even though it was positive!!!!!!!!!!! This was because of how late it was compared to when she actuall posted it. That's also what told me that the earlier someone responds to a post, the more the responder cares about the original poster. And so every time we'd end up having a family event I'd always freak out because I was so afraid of missing Hailey. So it's not new ever since I followed these two artists.
Now I've tried googling anything relating to that notion - that the faster response time means that they care more - and I only found posts relating to business / customer Facebook pages, which wasn't what I was looking for. Because I'm still looking for a job, I've been far more fearful about finally starting to work just because of this FOMO. And obviously I hate being the last one to comment because it's obvious I will not even get a response from the original poster. I've seen that happen too many times I care to remember, even if the comment was positive.
So why hasn't this been researched more? Why is it difficult to find articles that otherwise prove my theory wrong? Is it actually true that the faster someone responds to a social media post, the more it appears they care? It always hurts to even be second in line, if someone else has already hit the LOVE button on a post before I do, because that makes me think they're far more important than me. At the same time, I wonder how people who are at work manage this. If they're in the middle of a job and they see that the post got tons of reactions within a few minutes, that really seems confusing to me. I wonder how much bravery it's going to take for me to actually get over that fear of commenting later because I just hate not being heard, and I'm still worried that the later I respond the less likely I will be heard.
Looking forward to some insights on this.",1717275273.0,NEGATIVE,0.9990434050559998

1932,1932,Facebook,How can i do this correctly without breaking any rules of Facebook or meta?,"Sorry if i commit any mistakes, English in not my first language.

Ok, so i have a problem that is NOT normal here.... i already searched online and nothing answered my question for real...  
First i am creating this ""professional persona"" online that will be me for now on(it is not someone else, it is just a nickname that someone i dont want to see would never think to look for, and my real full name will not be anywhere there and i changed my appearance a bit too), for security reasons i will not put that nickname here as anyone can imagine why...

So, my problem in a nutshell: i speak 4 languages and am learning 5 more, i have this idea for some youtube channels and blogs that i am cooking for a while now and i want to do them in those languages... BUT everything on one email would make me nuts, so i am creating on email for each language, all the issues with one adsense account for the other accounts in different emails i already reach the comunnity and is solved... i can do that...

BUT now i am having a problem with instagram and i am sure i will have a problem with facebook too saying i am on a ""public proxy"" or something next time i try to creating a new account... i want to create each channel, blog, facebook and instagram profile, and so on, on each email for each language...

so for example ""@ The Dog"" for the email, name of the channel, name of the profiles and so on for the ""english world"" and ""@ El Pero"" for the ""spanish world"" and so on...

the content will be ""kind of"" the same, but dubbed, subbed and translated the each language speakers and some content WILL BE exclusive for that language.... is that against facebook and instagram rules? if so, how can i do that in a way i dont do anything wrong?  
i want different profiles so i can enter different groups and have different friends and contacts in each language, and so i can get more organized like ""now it is time to work in this language""... i already use the browser vivaldi with multi profile activated so having multiple users is pretty easy for me and i dont need to deal with that option of multi account on google that never works correctly... Anyone can help? :/

and i want to work with facebook and instagram ads in the near future, so what are my options to do what i want or what i should do?

2062,2062,Facebook,I need some help with managing my elderly father's Facebook profile and how to safeguard him from scams,"So as many of you are probably aware of, elderly people get taken advantage of and scammed constantly on Facebook. My father, not unlike many other peoples parents is a serial Facebook user. This fall his account was taken over by some Turkish hacker and it took a while for us to get it back (thank god we did). It was at that point I realized how truly insidious and laughable Meta's safeguards for accounts is. I spent half a day on recovering his account and Meta was of barely any help, as the hacker had changed my father's accounts email address and made a new account with my father's email. We thankfully got it solved and I've now secured his account with 2FA and all the other latest security measures.

The problem here is that my father is starting to become, well to put it lightly, a bit senile. He can't tell if a profile is real or if it's a fake. This causes him to like, follow and comment on all kinds of profiles that completely clog up his feed. Thereafter the algorithm works its magic and only suggests even more of this complete garbage. I've basically taken the role of ""hiding the bottles"", meaning I have access to his account and I make sure to unfollow/unlike all of these garbage pages. This is getting extremely exhausting and I've spent this evening trying to basically re-mold what content his algorithm suggests for him by clicking ""show less of this"", but it seems to be to no avail.

I guess what I'm asking from you Redditors is for some advice on how to make my life easier in managing his profile, as well as limiting his risks of being scammed/encountering dangerous situations. At this point I feel it's essential for me to also disclose that I have gone through the whole Privacy setting page and cranked everything to the absolute max, which has helped a bit.

I wish it could be as easy as being able to ""child-lock"" my father's Facebook account into not being able to do anything else except interact with his existing friends and acquaintances, and of course watch some funny hedgehog videos. 

It'd make life a whole lot easier for elderly people's children, if Meta allowed for ""guardianship"" over a Facebook account to limit their usage of the app. This of course is something I will never expect to see from such a rotten company as Meta, that has allowed elderly people to be taken advantage of for years, which seems to only be ramping up all the time.

Anyways, I'd appreciate any tips from you guys if you have any to share. I feel like I'm truly swimming up against a current here. ",1717108307.0,NEGATIVE,0.9992902278900146

2070,2070,Facebook,"FB Page got ""unpublished"" - made 3 pages and now I can't even make or manage pages anymore","So, I've got this BS on my FB Page. It had an IG account linked to it.

Made another page, linked IG again, page got unpublished 2 days later. 

Made a third and final page, linked IG, in 10 minutes it got unpublished again. And as soon as I figured out the IG is causing it too, it was too late to make a 4th without linking. Because I got restricted from making and managing both pages and groups


I use these FB pages for business, I'm trying to advertise products on there. I've never posted offensive, rule-breaking, or copyrighted content there, of any kind. 

There is no option to directly appeal these either. 

I've contacted the support agents through (through business support) chat multiple times, some flat-out don't understand, some tell me they'll have a ""supervisor"" send me an e-mail (it's always just another clueless agent not resolving my issue). 

Sometimes they hint at my account violating the ""inauthentic identity"" policy (I don't remember if that's the exact name). 

It's confusing because not only is my personal account managing these pages in my real name - it's also been verified by both me uploading a selfie to prove me being real and a photo of my driving licence!!! 

Maybe it's because my name is very different and very rare in the country I live in since I'm kind of a minority but I'd hope the system isn't that stupid. 


What can I do about this? I really haven't got the time for this bullcrap. 

I've heard about there being dispute resolution arbitration courts for EU based people, which I luckily am, did someone ever give this a try, how much did it cost / how long did it take? 


Actually the easiest thing to do would be for me to somehow get my hands on an agent who's not a clueless, outsourced moron, but rather someone with some sentience and authority. 

I'd appreciate any help.

I have read the previous post about joining from Instagram but my accounts are not linked so fb is not showing there. Just I  business suite



Hi all, do through my own dumb actions I got hacked yesterday. I managed to go through the provide ID process and reset my password which is great. But I have 2 FA (Google authenticator) activated and it's not working. I imagine the hacker changed the details as they did change the email and phone number in the account.

I have restarted my phone, Uninstalled the authenticator and ensured the date time etc is synced. Removed firewall, updated browser etc. 

I think facebook is sending the code to the phone number the hacker put in the account so I am not receiving it. 

The next steps from fb help is to re upload my ID, which I did but it still doesn't get around the 2FA.

For context, I can't just abandon the page it is for a business. I can access the page through Meta business suite via Instagram and can make posts etc, but not change any of the security settings.

I don't use FB.  My grandma is 81, and she is French.  She has an iPhone (which I also do not use- I'm an Android user).  She says that in the last few months, she has been clicking to read some stories and then clicking on ''next,'' the next page is an ad stating her device is infected, etc.

Now, she knows (I've told her) that her device isn't infected and that this is a scam.  I checked her phone with Malwarebytes and just installed 1Block (paid).  It has done nothing.

Do you guys have any suggestions on how to get rid of this? It needs to be something reasonably automated, or else, I'll get 20 calls a day asking me what to do.  Is there a blocker specifically for these on the Facebook app?

PS: We got her the latest iPhone, and she made us get back the 7 as she couldn't grasp the changes.  Getting a new phone is out of the question (She only has a few months left/acute leukemia).  I want to make her last few months as happy as possible and this FB app is about the only one she uses.

Edit: Oh, I forgot to add.  I mentioned that she is French because this well-known scam appears to her in French, so I'm unsure if trying Wipr, 1Blocker, etc...wouldn't work because the ads are in French.  I am pretty sure that most app makers consider this, but I figured I'd throw it in as I'm not 100% sure.

TY MODS for reviewing this post and allowing it. After hours of research, trying so many things, changing her settings, and installing different apps, I'm unsure where else to turn. Ublock Origin takes care of everything for me on the PC...",1716943184.0,NEGATIVE,0.9956580400466919

My grandfather passed away about a year ago and my grandmother is very rapidly filling her empty time with near-infinite scrolling on Facebook and I don't want her to fall into the same pitfalls of social media many of us younger folk had to navigate out of, and I'm finally happy I don't subject myself to that anymore. Here is the main issue I'm having:

My grandma will endlessly scroll on Facebook on her phone and about every minute, she scrolls past those AI-generated reels and they're all talking about death, grieving, moving on, not moving on, finding someone else, not finding someone else, etc. She's obviously being targeted based on keywords or whatever, but it's incredibly gross, inhuman, and it's not letting her process her grieving in a natural and healthy way, especially if these reels are ""prolonging"" the process.

My brother and I did everything we could by going on Facebook on her desktop and trying to unfollow and unlike as many pages as we could that don't seem necessary other than things she likes such as cooking pages, comedy pages, old musicians, etc. I have done my best to report ads, use the ""Reduce More"" feature, absolutely everything I can think of. Yet, as I sit here typing this, she scrolls her phone endlessly and the horrid AI reels continue to infest her feed.

I cannot find any way to turn this garbage off, but I don't want to cut my grandma off from social media, because that's how she connects with her old friends and shares things, but this other side of it is psychologically damaging and I want my grandma to be able to process things organically and not be force-fed creepy AI posts keeping her in a sad loop.

Two factor authentication? (With an app? My mobile number? A physical security key?)

2274,2274,Facebook,### Title: Help Needed to Recover My Facebook Account After Phone Theft,"
Hi Reddit,

I'm in a bit of a tough spot and could really use some help. My phone was recently stolen, and the person who took it removed all my information from my Facebook account. To make matters worse, I don't have access to my ID right now, which is complicating things further.

Here's what happened:
- My phone got stolen.
- The thief removed all my information from my Facebook account and changed the email associated with it.
- I still have access to the email that was originally associated with the account, but not the new one.

I've tried reaching out to Facebook support, but without an ID, it's been a challenge to prove my identity. Has anyone else been in a similar situation? What steps can I take to recover my account with access to the original email but not the current one or my phone number?

Any advice or tips would be greatly appreciated. Thank you in advance for your help!",1716831545.0,NEGATIVE,0.9975977540016174

2276,2276,Facebook,My family member's facebook account has been hacked Need Help Recovering it,"Alright, so my mom's account was hacked and for whatever reason facebook recovery method is beyond useless.

I tried using the recovery option for having your account compromised and it is completely useless. It asks me for the name of the account which I select then it asks me for an ""old password"" which I put in. Then it asks me how I would like to recover giving me two options.

1.  Use the current password (This is absolutely useless since it's been changed)
2. Send a recovery email to my email address (Which has also been changed)

When you type in an ""old password"" it just loops you around to asking to put in the ""old password again"" or try another method giving you the above 2 options. If anyone has a solution to fix this problem that would be great. Making a new facebook account is out of the question, she has a lot of personal photos on her account from dead relatives and she didn't take the time to back them up.

2311,2311,Facebook,Facebook needs to be held accountable for hacked accounts. They will not do anything even after reporting the account several times,"Facebook needs to take accountability. My mom’s account was hacked in 2020. At that time we couldn’t log in and thought she forgot her log in info so we just started over with a new account. Fast forward to March 2024. It said she changed her profile picture. My mom never uploads photos of herself because she just doesn’t care to have her picture anywhere. The profile picture was her and a friend. I quickly realized this is account was hacked. The photo used came from a friend’s account which my mom was not even tagged in so these hackers studied other photos of her that other people tagged her in to find a photo on another account.  At that time I tried reporting the account as fake and impersonating someone. Facebook said the account doesn’t violate their community standards. I made posts on that account’s wall saying that this account was hacked and it’s not my mom. She has many work contacts as friends and I did not want them thinking it was her if anything inappropriate was posted. The account remained quiet for a little until today May 26, 2024. The account deleted my posts and uploaded a video of being on a boat in the ocean. I made comments on the post as family and friends were liking and commenting. I then continued to report the account. I was then blocked from the account.

Facebook is doing absolutely nothing to take this page down or recover the account. The email was changed and that’s why we couldn’t access it to begin with which we didn’t realize at that time. They did not send the email that they supposedly do if you attempt to change the email associated with the account. I’ve tried numerous times and had friends and family report the account and Facebook will do nothing. There is no way to talk to support and explain, they just have lists of little help links that do nothing. It’s extremely frustrating when Facebook says the account doesn’t go against their community standards, sure it doesn’t go against their standards but it goes against mine because that is not my mom. What happens if these hackers post something inappropriate and her work sees it? She has been a well respected nurse for 40 years so her reputation is on the line. Will Facebook pay her if she were to get fired over this? I think not. Facebook holds absolutely no accountability even when you seek help and report an issue to them.

I'm helping my friend with their account. They currently can't access Marketplace, being ""told their listings don't meet community guidelines"" (total bs). But when we choose ""request review"", we're promptly told the account does have a valid email address or phone number....which it does. A while back the account was hacked and we had to upload their ID to get everything handled, but for some reason Facebook rejected it (despite the fact you can see everything clearly).

So what we're hypothesizing is if I reupload the ID it should fix everything. However when I get to the page to do this, all it does is take me to the 2-step verification page, and you guessed it, NOTHING about uploading the ID.

I got the usual text stating that my account is locked because of ""unusual activities"". The ""learn more"" or ""get help"" buttons are not in the locked page so i clicked the ""chat with us"" button. It will usually say that the queue for the wait is too long but just refresh the page until you can chat the bot. When you're in the chat conversation with the bot, press the ""send video"" button.  After that, the bot will require you to give an email account that isn't linked to any facebook account. Once you do that, it will say that your conversation has expired but don't think that it didn't work, go to the gmail of the account that you sent to the bot and it will have a message from the meta team. It will have a code that you will need to write on a paper and you'll have to make a selfie video. Make sure to mirror the video so that the handwritten code will look right on the video. And also make sure that your face is seen clearly with the paper. Make sure to follow the instructions thoroughly. Move your head up, down, left right. And move the paper that you're holding up, down, left, and right. Compress the video down to under 10Mb because it will not send if it is too big.

2373,2373,Facebook,How to Recover Your Disabled Instagram Account in the United States: A Comprehensive Guide,"If you’ve ever faced the frustration of a disabled Instagram account, you’re not alone. Many users experience this issue and struggle to regain access. Here’s a comprehensive guide to help you navigate this challenging situation and explore all possible avenues for resolution.

1. Understand the Reason for Disablement

First, Instagram usually disables accounts for violating their community guidelines or terms of service. Common reasons include posting inappropriate content, using third-party apps, or engaging in spammy behavior. Review Instagram’s guidelines to understand the possible reasons for your account’s disablement.

2. Submit an Appeal

Open the Instagram app and log in with your credentials. When you see the message saying your account has been disabled, tap “Learn More” to find out why it was disabled. If you believe it was a mistake, tap “Appeal” and follow the on-screen instructions to submit your appeal.

3. Provide Required Information

Instagram may ask for some information to verify your identity, such as your full name, email address, and a photo of yourself holding a handwritten code they provide. Ensure you follow these instructions carefully to avoid any delays.

4. Be Patient

The review process can take several days to a few weeks. During this time, avoid submitting multiple appeals as it may slow down the process. Keep an eye on your email for updates from Instagram.

5. Escalate the Issue

If you haven’t received a response:

- Document Your Efforts: Keep a record of all attempts to contact Instagram support, including emails and any responses.

- Use Multiple Channels: Try contacting Instagram support through their official Facebook page or Twitter account.

6. Legal Steps

If all else fails, consider the following legal actions:

- Send a Formal Notice: Draft a legal notice detailing your issue and send it via certified mail to Instagram.

- Consult with a Lawyer: Seek advice from a lawyer specializing in digital law or consumer protection. They can provide specific advice and help you understand your legal options.

- File a Complaint with the FTC: If you believe Instagram has acted unfairly, you can file a complaint with the Federal Trade Commission (FTC).

7. Advanced Escalation Strategies

If legal steps do not resolve the issue:

- Executive Email Carpet Bomb (EECB): Send a well-crafted email outlining your issue to several executives within Meta (Instagram’s parent company).

- Influencer Advocacy: Reach out to influencers or public figures who might be able to escalate your issue.

8. Alternative Dispute Resolution

- Mediation and Arbitration: Some disputes can be resolved through mediation or arbitration, involving a neutral third party to help reach a resolution.

9. Consumer Advocacy Groups and Legal Clinics

- Consumer Protection Organizations: Seek help from consumer protection groups like the Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF) or local consumer rights organizations.

- University Legal Clinics: Many universities have legal clinics offering free services provided by law students under attorney supervision.

10. Alternative Platforms and Backup Plans

- Diversify Your Online Presence: Build a presence on other social media platforms to avoid dependency on one.

- Backup Accounts: Create backup accounts with clear documentation and policies to prevent similar issues in the future.

11. Legal Action as a Last Resort

- Class Action Lawsuit: Consider organizing a class action lawsuit if many others are experiencing the same issue.

- FCC Complaint: File a complaint with the FCC if you believe Instagram’s actions fall under their jurisdiction.

Conclusion:

Exhausting all possible avenues can be a lengthy and challenging process. If you’ve followed all the steps, including legal and public advocacy, without success, weigh the costs and benefits of further action. Sometimes, focusing on alternative platforms while seeking a resolution in the background might be the best course of action. 

Document every step you take and keep exploring new avenues to address your issue.

I keep that separate from my personal profile - when I participate under my own name, it's usually just as a regular participant, not with my admin hat on.

A few days ago something happened that puzzled some group members, and it's because of something Facebook did that only an admin can see.  So I went to the post to leave a comment, switched to acting as the page rather than as my personal profile, made the comment... and got a popup error message, ""something went wrong"".  The comment had a red outline and a ""try again"" link below, but trying again just got the same error.

Since then, I have tried making that comment again a few times each day, both on a web browser and from my Android FB app, and it always fails with the same useless error message and no guidance about what went wrong.  When I comment under my own name, it works fine.

- I've re-checked group settings, it is set to allow pages to post.

Because of this, another member of the group split off and created a new group promising ""honesty, no judgements and camaraderie"". I joined the new group and it was nice for months. You could post topics for discussion or ask for advice. I had trouble with the last post I made in there as people weren't understanding the point of my post so I messaged her, the admin who says to message if there is any trouble, and her reply was "" what do you want from me? "" ""I'm working right now"" and when I tried to backup thinking oh shit my message must have come across poorly, I start to say, 
""Why did you say that? it's not a big deal just wanted to touch base on something in the group..."" but before I could finish the thought she said "" there's something wrong with you, you need therapy"" then immediately blocked me and kicked me from the group. It was an absolutely unbalanced interaction and I'm still baffled by it. 
We live in two different countries so maybe it's a difference in the way things are said/done and there was a misunderstanding?
The only think I can think of as to why she reacted that way is because my business is struggling so I came to her group for help a lot. Maybe she had been annoyed with me for a while.

Question{ing} - FB Dating Application/Applet. What's a guy to do? I don't know their code. Coding or hacker issue? What's the cause?

Removed | Rule 9

Okay, so I thought I'd try the built-in dating feature on Facebook, and for forever and a day (it feels like - even though it of course has not been that long) - the screen on my phone seems to flash and glitch out whenever I use FB Dating - specifically Dating - no other applications or applets on Facebook, and sometimes when the screen is flashing I see a "" 0 , "" flash on the screen as well. I am so very bothered by this, and I don't know the code being used in FB Dating Application, so I don't know what is causing it. Do you think that this is just some weird glitch with FB Dating itself, or is some low-life hacker trying to tell me that I'm a zero?

The rest of the screen is blank. Took a screenshot and I end up with a blank white screen and gray bars. Just a zero and a comma - no other text shows on the screen. I don't get this issue using any other applications on my phone overall - just FB Dating.

What's going on with this?

Please help, somebody. This is f<c<ing with my psyche. I could always ditch Facebook, but I really want to know what's causing this.

I just want to know the cause of this, mostly. How to resolve it if it's a coding error, sure. But what is causing this?",1716630984.0,NEGATIVE,0.9995824694633484

My question is - is it possible for a glitch in Messenger to show an incorrect reply preview of  photo that was never sent (or deleted) in the chat? Could it somehow pull it from my chat with him in a glitch?

3. what's very axhausing is that, even when i'm don't use a lot my personal account.... this personal account is the manager/administrator of the fanpage from my workplace. The fanpage isn't blocked. But I don't have access to it, and given that I'm the administrator, I can't just create another account and expect to administrate it (I'm the only f one working on it :/ )
4. All the options that the support/help page give, haven't worked  for me. The options that I think would work, demand me to be log in - again T.T  so the blocked circle start again... i log in, it send me to the block page, and I can't access to the help page :(

PLEASE somebody give me more ideas to try jajajaja :(

2499,2499,Facebook,Facebook and hacker issues regarding 2FA and Check Point Verification,"A hacker from Ninh Bình, Vietnam, obtained my phone number and email from a security breach at my bank. He uses the email lesbennsuk, which is a Hotmail address. This email is connected to another email created using Getnada. Getnada supplies temporary email handles that, according to my understanding, expire within 10 minutes. He uses a Galaxy S20 Ultra 5G, which is not my phone.

The hacker, using my email as a starting point, has managed to locate my account and exploit the Facebook Reset My Password option. Through some form of manipulation, he has altered the master login email to my profile and even set up Two-Factor Authorization. These sophisticated methods underscore the need for immediate action and enhanced prevention measures.

When I discovered the changes, Facebook asked me if my account was hacked. Of course, being naive, I said yes. That was the biggest mistake. Facebook proceeded to immediately lock my account so neither I nor the hacker could use it. The thing is, the hacker does not need to use my profile.

The hacker used my phone number to create a new Facebook profile but was clever enough not to use my name. I used the same password reset option to get into this profile, change his password, and remove my email and phone number.

This freed up my account so that I may reset the password. However, regaining access to my profile has been impossible because of Two-Factor Authorization. The hacker's information is still in my account, which recovery uses to ""verify"" my identity. I see none of the verification codes Facebook claims can unlock my account.

The last thread in this is that, though I've managed to reset my password numerous times, it is the CHECKPOINT that screws me. 

The ridiculous CHECKPOINT does not read my master login email. It defaults to an old college email address I cannot access anymore. The CHECKPOINT never even shows my master login email. It shows phone numbers for SMS, but doesn't work. Finally, the hacker used his information to set up WhatsApp, so any verification codes go straight to HIM.

I get punished for the misdeeds of another a world away. I have a new Facebook account, but my WHOLE LIFE is on the hacked account: business, friends, family that are dead, pleasure. All of that is locked behind a checkpoint.

The ID verification only resets the password, not unlock my account at the checkpoint. I am incredulous that I can change the password 20 times and still not access the account. If the CHECKPOINT read my master login email, theoretically, I could unlock it. It's been nearly 90 days. The hacker STILL goes in and changes my password every now and then, even though he can not use the account!

""Something went wrong. Please try again later""

2 - It never used to happen, but now I need to login every single day for my kids, sometimes even several times a day. For some reason, it logs them out frequently.

Is this because I have 2 FB profiles? If I switch out of my parent account to login to the other, does it log my kids out?

2604,2604,Facebook,[Solved] How to bypass/skip Facebook messenger end to end encrypted chats,"Ever since Facebook messenger launched end to end encrypted chats, like many others have experienced, we are forcefully presented with a page where there are 3 options to select for accessing chat history. As with many of us who used Facebook messenger for years prior to this end to end encrypted chats feature that was launched recently, we just want things to work as it did before and none of the 3 options presented is what we want. Even if we force close the messenger app and reopen, the prompt will still be presented and we have to choose something before we can access our chat history. The reason I believe is because Facebook wants to force encrypted messages on their users by making users select an option before they are able to reach the page to access existing messages (which are not encrypted).

Thankfully today I accidentally found a way to avoid selecting any of the 3 options presented. Note that by doing this method, it means that you do not want to use the encrypted messages feature which Facebook rolled out recently, which requires the user to select 1 of 3 options forcefully presented when first opening messenger app.

Here's how to do it. Go to Facebook app, find a friend and go to their profile page and click on message button. The messenger app will be opened automatically to start a conversation or open up the existing conversation (if you have chatted with the person before). Now press back and viola you will be able to access all your existing chats.

Now to double check that encrypted messages is not enabled, on messenger app, go to settings, privacy & safety, end-to-end encrypted chats, secure storage, check that it is set to off. If you're interested in more information on encrypted chats, refer to the help article below.

2614,2614,Facebook,Personal Account Hacked (via session hijacking) - questions regarding recourse ,"Hey!! Sorry this is going to be a long one, just regarding my facebook account which has been hacked



Long story short - My Personal facebook account was compromised through Session Hijacking (they managed to get to my old email which I used to login on facebook). Had 2FA setup and they managed to bypass that even. Think this was done when I used airport wifi. They ran ads these last 2 days with my business account and drained about $600 from my bank account (I have cancelled the bank card already).

I managed to get my PERSONAL ACCOUNT back thankfully but they completely removed access to my FACEBOOK BUSINESS PAGE + changed the email for that.

My FACEBOOK BUSINESS ACCOUNT, and INSTAGRAM ACCOUNT was linked to my PERSONAL ACCOUNT (I changed credentials to my Instagram account). My Instagram account and Facebook business page were linked to one another. NOTE - on my Instagram meta account, I can’t see anymore that the FACEBOOK BUSINESS PAGE is linked to the INSTAGRAM account.



Would be great to get my Facebook business account back. It isn’t public anymore so I am sure that they have unpublished it.



Even if I don’t have access to that Facebook business account (they changed the email address and password) for some reason I can still see from my PERSONAL ACCOUNT that they’re logged in - I can’t log them out as I can’t access the Facebook business account, since they have changed the email 



Thank you for making it this far! Anyways, my questions are:



**1. Is there any way I can get my facebook business account back? I can’t even access it since they’ve changed the email. I have tried to lodge a ticket with Facebook, but I can’t even see the Business Account as an option when lodging the ticket, so I am unable to lodge a ticket on that specific Facebook business account.**

**2. If I can't get it back, then is there any way they can access my FACEBOOK PERSONAL account, if they still have access to that FACEBOOK BUSINESS account? Or can they access my INSTAGRAM account even though it is no longer linked to FACEBOOK BUSINESS account?**

2628,2628,Facebook,Sudden Drop in Facebook Reels Views Due to Algorithm Change – Need Advice!,"Hi everyone,

I’m reaching out because I’ve encountered a significant issue with my Facebook Reels, and I’m hoping for some advice or insights.

Up until recently, my Reels were doing exceptionally well, often getting around 10k views within an hour of posting, And get around 45k views in under 24 hours. My content generally performs best at around 7:40 AM and 6 PM, and I’ve been quite consistent with my posting schedule and engagement strategies.

https://preview.redd.it/397sn80axy1d1.png?width=163&format=png&auto=webp&s=46d2799d41d9273b90b298125b108afa1dc3098a

However, I’ve recently noticed a drastic drop in views, likely due to a recent algorithm change. My latest Reel got only 12 views, which is a massive drop from what I usually get. This is extremely discouraging, as I rely on these views for monetization and growth.

Here’s a bit more context:

https://preview.redd.it/py28q4tbxy1d1.png?width=84&format=png&auto=webp&s=7b3b77da05df8a113b66d82eb6cb4f8f1d03a993

* **Regular Schedule**: I post my Reels consistently, targeting times that have historically been best for engagement (7:40 AM and 6 PM).
* **Engagement**: I actively engage with my audience through comments and interactions.
* **Quality Content**: I strive to maintain high-quality content that resonates with my viewers.

Despite these efforts, the sudden drop has me worried that my future posts might also perform poorly. I’m considering whether I should take a break from posting or if there are specific strategies I should try to adapt to the new algorithm.

Has anyone else experienced a similar drop in views due to an algorithm change? If so, how did you manage to recover? Any tips or advice would be greatly appreciated!",1716379494.0,NEGATIVE,0.9921286106109619

My theory is that these people, sorry, these scammers, they have a bunch of fake accounts and they start reporting your posts with their fake accounts, wait until they see you aren't able to make posts, and then pretend to be Facebook support.   It's happened several times like this, most recently for a local non-profit soccer club and I am convinced it can't be a coincidence at this point.  Is it just me?

2644,2644,Facebook,Is it a violation of Facebook rules for a FB group profile to lie about what it about?,"I tried to join a local group that discusses diversity initiatives for our town and schools.  I am neither right wing nor left wing on this issue, and was truly hoping to just get more information about what initiatives people werer working on and discuss the best ways to support and protect diversity in our community.  The group's description seemed open and amenable to all reasonable discussions, and the listing of who was not allowed to be a member was limited to schoool an government officials, of which I am neither.   They asked me to fill out a questionnaire about why I wanted to join and mentioned that I was concerned that I had been hearing about some diversity initiatives that excluded certain groups and I also mentioned my race.  I was rejected from the group and when I asked why they indicated that the group was only for people who supported Critical Race Theory as the basis for any diversity initiative and they wouldn't let me in unless I assured them that I was supportive of that particular theory.  That made me extremely uncofortable since CRT is pretty controversial as far as diversity initiatives go.  I mean, I have no problem getting into a respectful discussions of its pros and cons but it seems pretty closed minded for a group to limit membership to such a narrow niche and fringe type of diversity initiative.  I honestly feel that either they were simply discriminating against me due to my race and coming up with a ""rule"" that applies to nobody else but me (since their description mentions none of this and the existing members I know offline were suprised to hear this was a rule), or at the very least, they are being very deceptive in their group profile about what their true intentions are.  Seems like this should violate some facebook rule, but I'm not sure if facebook really cares about stuff like this.  I mean, people are free to form whatever groups they want and exclude whoever they want, I just think they are lying to the pubic about the groups true intentions.  To me it is just as egregious if they were a ""diversity"" group that was secretly run by some right wing organization like Moms for Liberty or something and tricked people into joining it.

2682,2682,Facebook,Facebook Monetization Violation but Request Another Appeal greyed out because I “don’t have any current violations” ,"So, I am a popular content creator (prefer to stay anonymous on Reddit) with over 8M followers across socials. I am monetized on all of them EXCEPT for Facebook. I grew an account (at snail speed) last year to 20k followers but got a Facebook Monetization Violation flag somewhere along the way, and despite trying to clean up/delete any posts that may have caused the issue, I could never get rid of it. I also got to the point where my “Request Another Review” was greyed out. On that Page, I had Stars and Bonus on regular posts, but I could never get onboarded for Ads on Reels, which is what I wanted because those earnings would actually be meaningful. I also was restricted on some level because my posts would never hit the millions despite the same posts hitting multi millions on my other socials.

About a month ago, I decided to start over. I deactivated that Profile and Page, and made a new account Profile and then a new Page. When I first started, I immediately had a video shoot to almost 4M views, followed by two other to half a million, so I knew the restriction was gone. As far as policy violations, I still had to things keeping me from Monetization but I wasn’t deterred because one was for being a new account less than 30 days old and the other was a violation that I saw on YouTube most people get that eventually goes away once you hit 5,000 followers and are over 30 days old. *Please note* I did get a Monetization Policy Violation on the first video I posted (most likely because it was one of my very viral videos last month and someone had posted it to Facebook before I made this account) and so I deleted it and the MPV went away.

Fast forward 6-7 posts and everything is going well and then I noticed a MPV again. So I decided my latest Reel and it didn’t go away. Deleted the next one, and still there. So, I went back and deleted all the Reels I’d posted since the start, AND even used a brand new profile picture and background. Still there.

Since then, I’ve posted three more Reels. Good news- restriction is still gone because one got 3.6M views and one got 1.6M. Bad news- MPV is still there and now I don’t know what to do. Also important to note, the “Request Another Review” button has been greyed out since the issue started. When I float my cursor over it, it says I can’t request a review because I don’t have any current violations.

Has anyone had any issues like this? I know my latest three reels are completely clean so I’m at a loss.",1716310758.0,NEGATIVE,0.999580442905426
2683,2683,Facebook,Marketplace resellers are scammers? Deleting a listing after selling,"Facebook should do something about resellers and business hiding behind private accounts, these scammers sell things then they delete their listing so it doesn't look like they are resellers or a computer tech or whatever business..
For example I would never in a million years buy a laptop from a computer technician, because some of them shove what ever they have into a laptop and they're known to be scammers who refurbish faulty laptops.
Facebook shouldn't allow deleting listing, or at least the listing should disappear after a month or so..
I bought a used laptop from someone who had one listing, thought he was some random guy who wants to sell his laptop, it tuned out to be some scummy computer technician with no store or address to his name..
I drove 3-4 hours thinking it was a good deal, it turned out to be: he upgraded the ram by himself, the charger isn't the original charger and alot of scratches on lid (which weren't that big of a deal for me), the laptop wasn't bought from my country at all too, and highly suspect that he changed the battery too cause it says it has 100% battery health and 350 battery cycle which makes no sense.. right?
I thought he was an engineer who wanted to sell his laptop because when i looked up his number, his name was something IBM, and thought he was and IBM engineer, So I trusted him..
He was a Russian or Ukrainian immigrant or whatever eastern european country, so there was a bit of language barrier, I asked if he was an engineer(cause of his contact name) or if he had upgraded his ram and he simply smiled and nodded for both of the questions.. 
although the laptop is working fine but I can't open it to check The inside because of the screws..
Facebook shouldn't allow deleting a listing.
Denigrate people simply sell the item then they delete it so they don't look like resellers..
I should've known man.. I looked up his name everyday in marketplace because I suspected it, and yesterday I saw him publishing another 2 laptops..
Funny thing I'm pursuing a BSc in engineering and wanted to take his opinion about the courses and stuff but he didn't know what to answer and I assumed it's the language

2688,2688,Facebook,How should I deal with someone obsessively liking my posts and comments?,"

Edit** 

He is older, like, by 30 years I'd say. I have already changed settings to exclude this person from my audience, which is when he went in on old posts I know he's liked, and unliked them to like them again. I can't seem to change the settings for all my past posts, at once. For the person who suggested I confront him about it, I think you're probably right, though I just don't know where to start right now. What to say without being defensive. I also think I could wind up getting entangled in back and forth with him, so perhaps blocking is the better option. He's an old family friend, he was quite fond of my mum when she was alive and he and his then wife would visit her (and teenage me) back then. Thanks all for your comments. I think I need to bite the bullet and block him.

The story - 

I'm not usually on Facebook much (mostly for work purposes) but I recently noticed my mother has two accounts on FB, one that she uses (aka the one she remembers the password for) and another that is fairly old (about 8 or so years old). 

I noticed that possibly hacked or fake accounts have basically been putting up some posts for adult sites on her page, she of course doesn't want this on her page. 

As you could guess, she's forgotten not only the password but also the email account and number she used for this account. 

**
I've reported her old account a few times and tried to recover the password but it's been so long we can't really figure out what her password or number she may have used for it. 
**

Oh and not to mention when I tried to find a FB contact number for her I realised there's nothing like that out there to directly speak to a human lol 

As she's a little embarrassed of discovering what's been posted on her account, is there any idea what the best solution or process is to approach something like this or is it just a case of report and let it be? 

Sorry to bother you guys just figured I'd turn to reddit since it's not the first time a community on reddit has helped me out :) ",1716157628.0,NEGATIVE,0.9997616410255432

There are seven pages/groups that are all ran by the same small group of people (under different fake accounts). They steal all my topics - photoshop my watermark out - and post them in their various pages. I’m talking 100-120 posts per month. 

I’ve recently reported it to FB under the copyright act. They removed about 40 of the posts. But didn’t do anything to the thieves. Who didn’t even take a day off. Today, used 10 of my graphics on their pages - photoshopping my pages name off of the graphics. 

Does being Meta Verified give me any more power than I have now in terms of stopping these scammers? It’s a pain in the arse to file copyright claims against every single post (more than 100 a month).

2798,2798,Facebook,"Facebook Account hacked, Facebook support too incompetent to take action, hacker keeps on scamming people by selling stuff from my account","It's just really ridiculous and frustrating. As the title says, my German Facebook account got hacked alongside my registered Email Adress (same password, which, I guess was stupid on my end). Facebook allowed me to prove my identity by uploading my ID once, which gave me access to the account for a few minutes, but the hacker was still locked in an could simply change the password back. Now the \*\*\*\* automated support system does not allow me to prove my identity again and I have no way of getting my account back. I mean, there would be plenty of options to prove my identity but Facebook seems to be too cheap to provide these. They won’t even take action after the police ensured me that they notified Facebook about the account take-over. It’s already been 6 months and the hacker is still actively scamming people by fake-selling stuff from my account.

 In case anybody has an idea what I could do, I’d be grateful for suggestions. Otherwise, I just wanted to voice my frustration and reveal Facebooks incompetence and gross negligence when it comes to hacked accounts that actively “hurt” other people.",1716129857.0,NEGATIVE,0.9994372725486755

Her son and one of my sons were apartment roommates at college over the past year. Recently I noticed that she no longer appears to be on FB (does not come up in search, and obviously, no longer in my friends' list). I assume this means that *either* she unfriended and blocked me, or that she left FB and deleted her account.

I came across an old comment of hers in my FB memories - e.g., I can see her name and profile pic and the old comment is visible, but her name is not a link to a profile. Does this suggest that I have been blocked vs. her leaving FB altogether? Or would the old comment appear like this, in either case?

I guess it doesn't really matter - she's entitled to block me. I'm just puzzled by it and wondering what would have prompted her to do that.",1716119536.0,NEGATIVE,0.9990956783294678

I'm not trying to come up with excuses but I have autism( I was diagnosed as a child). Management is aware of this as well as my team leads. I don't know what to do anymore. I can't afford another write up because my coach believes I can't do my job correctly. I've looked up reasonable accommodations, but I can't find anything that would help me.

I dreamt I was at work and our trucks came in. I was called to help pull the pallets down and scan boxes in as they came off the pallets. It was also a sort of inventory day an a coworker and I were having to pull everything out of the meat cooler and count before I could put anything up. There was a team of people there working with us, and had a question about a price on something but couldn't find my coworker and didnt know anyone else. I walked down the halls to find her and went through a set of doors. It sort of looked the same but the hall was big long and empty and the few workers there had on brown uniforms, like ups workers. Walked past rooms that that were just about empty but they were moving small amounts of freight to them and something felt ""off"" for some reason. One worker had a clipboard and was marking stuff off as the others loaded it in. No one looked familiar. I kinda got scared and tried to find my way back and after turning down several hallways saw a set of doors that were like fire exit doors I hoped would lead to the main part of the store. I went through them and it was like a hotel or airport lobby waiting area, not our store at all. There were people there in regular clothes all looking at me weird cause I had my vest on. Went back and kept finding and going through doors that led to different areas, one was a mall (mall world Lol) and one even led to an outdoor courtyard with plants and trees but no people. 
There was a whole lot of other stuff, but this is already long enough. 
Weirdest part is that I hardly ever dream anymore. First one I've had in about 3 years. I can remember. My first dream in over 3 years was literally a Walmart nightmare Lol

He showed me a lot but there are still a lot of questions that I need answered. He told me to never Flex but it was almost impossible to reshop because there were so much clothing with No Location.

1. When the floorplan is printed for a certain area, it only lists old mod numbers in certain locations and other locations that have generalized categories like ""shirts"" or ""pants"" etc. Are those 'flex locations' where you can put clothing that become ""No Location"" when you reset a mod or for New Clothing freight that does not have any Mod assigned to it in any 'old', 'current', or 'future' mod? In the online lessons, it talks about putting New Seasonal Clothing on outer racks and transfer to inner locations when seasons change.

2. Assuming there are flex locations on the floorplan (see No.1), can you mix brands in these flex locations?

3. When flexing, do you have to scan in every Size (S, M, L, LH, etc.)? What do you if you do not have a particular size available to flex in? I'm thinking it will show up as ""No Location""?

4. I'm assuming you wait for clothing in the 'home location' to become 'clearance', 'non replenish', or 'deleted' in order to Flex to a location?

5. Now, when clothing in the Flex location sells down and becomes ""Clearance"" to the point where you can put it in a pre-assigned ""Clearance Location"", do you have to delete that clothing in every size from the Flex Location they were in?

6. If all the above is true, then that would explain why when reshopping, you get whole lot of 'No Location' items unless you have access in the system to all the UPC numbers of every size.",1717329053.0,POSITIVE,0.9965498447418213

2998,2998,Walmart,Another Nightmare Night Shift,"Eww

I just had a nightmare of working there again. 

It wasn't self checkout, there were five registers six actually but they were all behind a counter as if it was a boutique. There's a huge line of angry customers and a couple of employees were just sitting on the bench including some coaches but they were all 'on break' and just watching a cashier's struggle.

Even though they know I quit, they yell at me go give them a hand and I was like sure why the hell not I'm bored. So I actually jump behind the counter start up the register and I called the next person with 10 items or less.

This woman comes up and I'm having a casual conversation while i check out her few things, she actually had like more than 10 items but she didn't have a carriage. Anyway she takes the Gatorade powder and I scan it,  and she's asking about how that comes in powder now and I said I think it just take the gatorade powder and you add it to the water. 

She suddenly freezes up and accuses me of calling her the n-word. Now there is nothing I said that was even close to rhyming with that so I instantly smell BS but she insisted I did and since I didn't over react or start panicking or making profuse apologies, she just keeps assuring me that I said it and when I smile and deny it, she starts talking all sorts of shit.

I can't remember everything we said to each other but I calmly retorted back to her anything. She says something along the lines of she can't imagine how screwed up my kids must be and I asked her why are hers model citizens.  She's saying I be needing some education, so I asked her for what.  There was a good one I forgot on her but I forgot what it was.  She then starts shoving her stuff across the counter that includes some trash that was in her basket including the banana peel.

Meanwhile everybody else is gone including the other customers and cashiers and I'm alone with this woman one of the coaches who was an ass hole didn't like laughed at me as he waves goodbye and turns off the  lights.

This bitch walks around the counter, so I go into robot mode and start saying ma'am you can't be back here constantly talking over her ma'am and you can't be back here, I will call the cops.

She starts trying to point her finger right to my nose and I knock her hand aside while still repeating the same thing over and over. She starts trying to claim assault and I say no she assaulted me when she put her hand in my face and I'll do it again I have every right to defend myself, regardless of what she interprets as facts.

That's when a few more guys suddenly show up, they are all laughing drunk or stoned but they're all just like leaning over the counter close to her and I can't tell if she's with them or not.

Then two of them wander behind the counter so I simply jump onto the counter and jump over it. I wouldn't call myself a coward but I'd really rather not fight 6v1.

That's when this bitch bolts and I chase after her but then I stop and realize that I hadn't locked my registers so I go and do that and then chase after her again. No I'm not AP and I'm aware that they are not supposed to chase I was just going to kick her ass

Unfortunately she vanished into the night. So that was my latest shift at Walmart, not too far from the real thing except for the manner in which the checkouts were laid.

Shoving a cart at an assosiates car and denting the doors on one side.

Passing customers formula from lock up, not walking it up, customer steals it and blames the assosiate running keys instead. 

Hitting on a male minor repeatedly, but it's fine because she is a woman and she is just playing around. [Yeah, totally fine. Hope you can feel the sarcasm.] When he complained to upper management, he was terminated. Fought it, lost it and now works somewhere else.

Asking assosiates to stay behind for the driver drop and then scolding them for having too long of a ""break"" between picking orders.

Making fun of assosiates for different things, clothing, being gay, not going to Church and then scolds people for not being respectful of her beliefs.

I'm a full time student and they know this, and had already had my schedule planned out where the min was 3 days per week, max 4 days out of the week. It was alright in the beginning, but for some reason during these last few months they started giving me more hours and putting me 4 days out of the week continously. Fine, whatever, I will tough it out. I did just that, and was fine, until finals week they somehow managed to schedule me 5 days out of the week for two weeks (not possible with my max hours availability). It was hell. I didn't say anything to the ppl lead or sm (I should've honestly) and was worked to the bone from school and work. My store is a very, very busy store as it gets ppl from two neighboring countries. I tough it out.  The hours started going back to sorta normal.All good, until I find that they scheduled me long five-5.5 hours shifts almost everyday the same time summer semester comes up. I decided to ask my people lead to cut down my hours as I'm going back to school that's an hour away mon-fri. She says sure and she will schedule me three days and verbally works out a plan . I think all is good. Wrong. Same shitty hours the following week. I'm distraught but ultimately take the loss. I go back and ask her for some sort of change she can make from now until i actually  have to work those hours. She then dismisses me and gives me the availability form. Few hours later, I get coached for something out of my control. The timing was too bad. I decided later that night I was gonna give in my two weeks note. Next time I work, nobody is there because they rarely are in the office. I leave my two week note there and hope for some change. Nope. I come to see today that they added another week of shitty hours. Even then, I decided that I was gonna verbally tell them today that I'm quitting and to start my two week (although three days later then I originally intended). NO ONE WAS THERE THE WHOLE DAY.

I was downvoted earlier today in connection with a post on how BYOD systems work in typical corporations based on experience I gained from helping organizations move from BlackBerry devices to a ""bring your own device"" system when BlackBerry exited the device market.

To whoever downvoted, I can assure you that Walmart CANNOT see the software that's installed on a personal device with Me@Walmart installed on it. To see any information about what's on a device, they would have to install mobile device management software like BlackBerry UEM or Workspace ONE Tunnel. That allows you to manage and remove apps from devices. They also have no way of knowing ANYTHING about your device use unless you connect to a Walmart WiFI network.

I'm not in a state where BYOD is available, but I'd never do it unless they gave a device allowance because job tools should be provided by employers.

I sighed once I saw it was a coworker who consistently gave me attitude and was rude and unhelpful towards me when I asked for help. I knew it would be trouble before even going down there. 

Fast forward, these two ladies in wife beaters show up to self checkout and they have a large tote. Apparently they were there to see if anyone would check inside their tote. I just got down there and thought they were paying and on their way out, and I also didn’t check bc I thought the person at the door was responsible for that?

I knew she was corporate that’s why I did my job” and I’m ngl I was flabbergasted bc why wouldn’t she say anything??? 

My team lead comes to self checkout and immediately before she says anything, my coworker hurries up and says “I knew that lady was corporate that’s why I did my job. She just stood up there with her hands in her pockets. I tried to signal towards her but she didn’t notice. She didn’t even have her hand held” and again I was flabbergasted because why is this random girl trying so hard to make me lose my job?

3076,3076,Walmart,The New Associate ,"So a new guy started last week,  just out of high school, never worked before. Kicked out of his parents house. 

I asked him politely to run an L cart of stock, not much on it. He ignored me 4 x and it was still sitting there at 5p when I left. 

At one point, I came back from lunch and he laying down on another cart, on his phone. He's been bringing food into the area, too. 

He told me he took the 1p to 10p shift because someone told him it was the easiest.

What would you do? 

UPDATE: He was really exhausted yesterday. And he left a lot of stuff unfinished that we walked into this morning...again.

I had been working two jobs and been dealing with stress. 

When I was called in, I was happy it was happening. I felt genuine joy  because I've been thinking of submitting my two weeks in but felt guilty because I was the only evening employee  in the department, and I felt bad. I was hoping they would hire someone soon so that I could leave. 
So what got me fired?
I accumulated 5 points due to illness and lastly due to a family emergency and not having enough ppto.

I tried contacting the woman who deals with scheduling to ask if it was necessary for me to show up anymore since I had the 5 points but couldn't outside my primary job work schedule.
So, I showed up, and it bothers me that they didn't fire me at the beginning but made me work most of the shift.

I have never been so happy to leave a job. I have never hated a job this much, and the only reason I hated it was due to micromanaging individuals who weren't even part of the department I worked for. I was almost never working in my department anymore, so I didn't even know what I was doing there anymore.

Though it was the first time I've ever gotten fired from one but I'm not too concerned about that.

3096,3096,Walmart,I feel like I need to vent here before I go insane,"And it's going to be hard to without incriminating myself if anyone from my store know who this is from. So I'll try sparing details as much as possible but we'll see.

Every waking night now at my store I feel like there's a a cloud looming over me that at any moment, I could be fired. Already I'm at a red warning for an otherwise not-so-serious occurrence whereas a month and a half prior, I was already handed an orange warning. So my store is that kind of store where they hand out warnings like candy and I already had waited an entire year for the yellow to expire. Yet, I'm somehow still close to being fired? The disciplinary policy is seriously broken by this alone.

And before anyone says or suggests, yes I've been trying to fight this but the problem is getting ahold of my SM who takes time off when you need her but when you don't, she's around.

I'll admit, I do have a bit of emotional issues, but not the kind where you look at me wrong and I'm thinking of ways to harm you. More like, you have to chip at and work at me to get me frustrated and that's what this store is unfortunately very good at. We hire more incompetent workers than we do decent ones and I am forced to deal with these kinds of people for weeks on end.

Taking their time at the baler, irresponsibly leaving ladder-carts stuffed with products and trash, taking things when I need them to do my job with, making top stock incomprehensibly challenging to where it's time wasting to sort and work with. Constantly plugging wrong products in where other products should be, even including seeing unopened boxes of product in the shelving! How can you be this careless?!

It's like these mistakes are too frequent to be like ""oh sorry about that"" ""oh sorry about that"" ""oh sorry about that"". I don't think you're sorry, I think you're careless and clumsy.

All of these and so much more, have been chipping at me for such a long time now and it's growing to a point where I am just so over and done with my store, yet I now cannot leave it via store transfer because of TLs finding tiny excuses to write me up for.

They keep doing this flip-flopping thing with me, where they'll advise me to do something unconventionally that isn't a problem to do so, but suddenly becomes a problem the next time. For example, I've been advised to take things that couldn't be top stocked by any means to the back to dump into the blue bins of returns. But at somepoint after, I'm finding myself lectured for doing the same thing that I was once advised to do.

This back and forth shit to me is just another system of theirs, to trip me up and make me uncoordinated with what I'm to do with my job.

And yet I am one of their more decent workers but because of this store's sheer unwillingness to get it's shit together, it's been fluctuating my productivity to where it's glaringly noticeable. Meanwhile, workers who're constantly chatting through their bluetooth earbuds, taking all shift to do 2 pallets of freight, getting into bouts of chatter with the nearest person. Yeah, these people somehow are still around but fuck the dude who simply just wants to clock in, do their shit and leave.

It really fucks with me how I'm praised for what I've done and getting all of these compliments from TLs and management for the work I do. But how quickly they are to tear me apart over some of the stupidest reasons they can imagine doing to someone. I'm almost at a point where I think that if I don't say ""good morning"" to someone I might get fired over it, it's that bad. That's how prissy and petty the overall store has gotten.

And I'm really between life and death here where if I lose this job, I mind as well commit suicide because this job is really the only thing holding things together for me. There are other places around me, yes, but their schedules don't work with me and their benefits aren't as appealing to me as Wal-Mart's is.

The only way to relieve some of this pressure is to meet with my SM. My store lead and I are on shaky ground and I was hoping so hard to not have to meet with her because her attitude is stern, dry and unmoving.

I am currently working alone in a small, shoddy gas station kitchen (and am absurdly underpaid for my area) and I’ve been going crazy. I’m super happy and can’t believe that I actually got myself the job. Today, after applying a couple of weeks ago, I still had not heard back from Walmart, so I walked myself to the customer service desk and asked to speak to the overnights hiring manager. I had already recently applied for days and been interviewed a couple of times for a couple of different positions, but nothing came out of it. I’ve been struggling to get rehired (anywhere) and had given up on working days. I knew the people that I spoke to at the customer service desk thought that I was a bit of a looney, and I, too, felt like one while professionally explaining that I wanted to go pester the hiring manager because I had not heard back from him yet. I knew I was taking a risk by randomly strolling into his office and asking for my application to be reviewed. The service staff eventually told me to go to the back of the store and meet him, and so I went to the back of the store and sat on a bench while I waited for him. Eventually, I heard a door open behind me, and my nervousness peaked. I followed an employee into his office, and then proceeded to assertively spill out my chain of thoughts in something of this order: *Hey, I just graduated, last week… I applied a bit ago… I already work nights… I have full availability… so I’m wondering if we could go over my schedule?* And… he liked my “manic energy”! He hired me on the spot. He liked my ambition and questioned me on it. I was so happy. I still am happy. I am technically still being hired; tomorrow I will be sent an email in regards to the next steps of the hiring process. I’ll be stocking. I didn’t expect anything more than a “I’ll review your application and get back to you” to come from my sporadic visit. I’m excited to start.

Now everything I've seen (currently in fast food) has been better and more my paced. Between the apps and environment. Only thing I seen that was a little funky was changing availability. But that's all besides the point. The question was. After some events that have happened in my family. Family time and holidays are very important to my family (this also includes deer hunting season).

She called me after I left and asked why I didn’t fill up carts and I explained I was off😐. The next day she saw me walking from break on my phone and completely scolded me, I went to the break room and cried on the phone and was telling my brother. One of her friends told her what I said in the break room and she fired me for misconduct . I want to appeal it because why didn’t the person who told her fire me…she’s a coach also. So it seemed like they had just fired me for no reason .

3167,3167,Walmart,Am I reliable if something were to go wrong?,"I’ve been working for Walmart for 3 1/2 months now and so far, it’s been going pretty well. Other than the few hiccups and mistakes which I understand is only part of being a new associate, especially since this is my first job in the retail field, but my team lead has praised me many times about being a fast learner and picking things up fairly quickly. So, I’ve become accustomed to the tasks and routines I’ve been taught a little after a month since I started working.

I’m on Stocking 1A and my tasks are basically topstocking, vizpicking, setting up for truck deliveries and all that. My team lead assigned each of us a section or sections to vizpick daily. For example, one of the daily sections I have to vizpick is HBA, but sometimes Candy, Infants and Pets/Papers/Chems will be added depending on how many of us are working.

HBA has its own topstock associates and I’m not entirely sure I’ve met all the members, but I definitely encountered 2 older ladies that always seem to be the only ones “working” that area everytime I stock. I know it’s not my job to topstock HBA but it is one of my tasks to vizpick and restock the area. Note - almost all the topstock shelf’s in HBA are messy, unorganized and cluttered ever since I started working. One of the ladies seem to always come to me while I’m in the middle of stocking and complain about how messy the shelves are and how they’re trying to keep it “organized” when in reality, I know she was trying to drop hints on not to put anything else on topstock if there’s no more room on the shelf. She would pretty much get on my ass if she catches me putting whatever’s left on topstock.

She would tell me if no more than 1 or 2 of an item doesn’t fit on the shelf, to take the overstock back to the back room and to not put anything else on topstock since it was cluttered and a mess. In my mind, i thought what she was telling me was routinely for everyone and maybe my team lead just forgot to mention that to me so I did as I was told. But something didn’t feel right in the back of my mind as I was taught if there’s no more room on the shelf, put it on topstock and if there’s no room on topstock, downstock items already up there until there’s enough room because we were not allowed to bring back partial boxes or too many full boxes of overstock. That’s what I’ve been doing without any issues for everything else but HBA.

It wasn’t until my team lead pulled me to the side and asked me to recite what to do if we had an item overstocked. I pretty much told her what I said previously, if it doesn’t fit on the shelf - put it on topstock - no room on topstock - downstock items until there’s room and all that. She said that I was doing everything correctly and thats when she brought up how she was having issues with this woman lately teaching me and other new associates the complete opposite of what was the correct way and when she goes to check the topstock availability tab, HBA would go literally multiple days at a time without anyone topstocking it, clearly causing it to be cluttered and unorganized. And when it was (very rarely) topstocked, it was never her name under the aisles that were done.

Fast forward to recently, I’m restocking shelves in HBA. Something I noticed ever since that conversation I had with my team lead is that she would follow me around each aisle and pretty much watch every move I make, but say nothing - I guess she got scolded by my team lead about it and knew she was in the wrong. So I usually just ignored her. Until when I couldn’t even make it past one aisle before she stopped me asking if I put an item on topstock that was clearly stacked too high up. I said no I had just started on restocking so I haven’t put anything up besides 1 item yet (which was only 3 small boxes of protein bars), yet she ordered me to take it down and I did so - not wanting any confrontation to happen. I go back and continued to unpack boxes until she asked me about another item that needed to come down and asked the same question. I was starting to get annoyed, but I calmly told her I only topstocked one item that couldn’t fit after downstocking a few items to make room.

She PROCEEDS to point out and order me to downstock multiple items while throwing in smart ass comments - “Has anyone taught yall how to topstock?”, “Clearly not”, “I’m gonna have to talk to [one of the managers] about yall”, “It’s messy cause yall put too much up there”, “yall clearly don’t know what you’re doing”. As soon as she turned around to help a customer, I silently took the rest of the HBA and headed to the back and handed it over to one of my teammates while I ran a grocery cart. (I’m thankful for her because she was the one that actually taught me a lot besides my team lead and understood how I felt). I was starting to get pissed with how she was basically shitting on our topstock team because SHE is the one not doing her job and wanted me to make it easier for her and harder for me or my team.

I managed to calm down enough to text my team lead since she wasn’t working that day and told her what exactly happened. Again, she told me I was doing everything correctly and she would talk to [the same one manager] about it and write out topstock rules for everyone to follow and was pretty much apologetic about what happened. She insisted that I be with her when she had the conversation and now I feel really nervous for when it happens. This lady has clearly worked here longer than me and I’m just a new associate that seems to be the only one that actually voiced this problem. I’m worried that I’ll somehow take the fall and blame for this issue even when I did as I was told by my team lead.

3174,3174,Walmart,Just spent the first quarter rearranging candy. ,"I was supposed to be stocking candy but since Walmart is full of lazy fucks who plug things they can't fit anywhere else, I had the pleasure of rearranging. Which resulted in me taking more things *off* the shelf, than I put on. 

There's no fucking excuse people. I know half of you are the person I'm complaining about so you're going to come in here and defend yourselves, but there's literally no excuse. Just start by saying ""Hi, lazy fuck here, this is why I'm a lazy fuck and put off work on the people who come after me....""


If it doesn't fit, top stock. If topstock is full, bin it. Don't know what that means? Ask. A. Fucking. Lead. 

If it is an item that doesn't even go on the shelf, don't just stick it somewhere. I just pulled two whole cases of a ""no location"" item off the shelf where tootsie rolls were supposed to go. 

I had to put off my break because the floor was full of candy that I couldn't find a place for and didn't have the space for it on my cart. I had to shove it all to the side while I grabbed a break pack to throw it all in. 

Seriously, if you even think about coming here to defend this shit. Go fuck yourself. Just quit. You don't deserve to have a job. I know the job doesn't pay well, but that doesn't give you the right to not do your fucking job and just put it off on the next guy.  This is literally the equivalent of throwing trash on the ground because ""the janitor will get it."" No excuse.

3177,3177,Walmart,Pregnancy accommodations?,"Ive worked at walmart since March of last year, I was full time in the bakery, found out I was pregnant around December, got extremely sick and stayed that way till now at 32 weeks. I feel I've done everything they asked me or expected me to do. I've moved to personal shopping, took a pay decrease, moved from full time to part time, filed for leave with sedgwick when I was missing weeks worth of work(which was denied because of failure to send out paperwork on time from both sedgwick and my doctor) ive done everything in my power to not be a ""bother"" to the work place. At this point I'm working about 5-10 hours a week, when I first moved departments I filled out the yellow paper for what hours I can work and put 6am to 6pm, no full time hours and i cant work 5 days in a row. They kept scheduling me anywhere from 4-6 in the morning 6+ days in a row and I had to call in because I couldn't work that. I guess they finally got the hint when they stopped scheduling so many days in a row but they kept the hours the same, since then I've asked over 5 times over the course of several weeks to be scheduled just a few hours later because of how bad my nausea is in the morning and that if they could do that I know for a fact  could make it in and actually work because I feel better around 8/9am vs 4/5am. One of the leads tells me I'll have to wait a few days because the main team lead is the one to work the schedule( I can tell they're all veryyyyy annoyed with me for asking about my schedule so much) well I can't wait that's long cause guess what they had me scheduled at 5 in the morning the days leading up to when she would be backand couldn't make it in to talk to her because I was sick and ended up calling in. I tried talking to the people lead that same day and she took a note but never fixed my schedule. This has been going on for probably 2 months and now they're just taking my days off and not scheduling me. 

I'm very upset, I would like to work and get something for maternity leave. I'm not even asking for physical accommodations just to change my schedule and work with me. Not get annoyed and take me off the schedule. Worst part is the team lead for that area just came back from maternity leave around the end of the year and yet she doesn't understand what I'm going through and now because of what they're doing ill be lucky to get anything for maternity leave. What can I do? Who do I talk to? I really want to work until 38 weeks if I can.

Thanks in advance, I'm sorry this is long and all over the place. Also the main reason I even left my first department was they just expected me to throw up and get back to work but when I did that and needed to sit down for a second afterwords I would get looked at funny by my team lead and get asked why I was sitting down and if this was a break. She treated the last pregnant lady badly and then did the same to me.

She told me she would put me in as full time and I’d start getting pto. every other week for months I had to go ask over and over again to be put in as full time and was told every time that she would do it. the last time I went up there I was told I didn’t work enough hours to be put in as full time that I needed to work 40 hour weeks for 12 weeks. I declined that and asked to be scheduled 32 hours because I wasn’t going to continue working full time for them when I wasn’t getting what I was told I would be getting. my team lead wants me to be full time, I told him the situation and he talked to my store manager. store manager says I need to work 40 hour weeks for 16 weeks straight then I can be full time in the system.

I was hired as a full time, open availability employee but was told by the manager that they would schedule around school or things to further my education. 

On May 22nd my manager came in on his off day to talk about it. He said I did not give him enough notice. 2 weeks was not enough. Reminder I informed them on May 20th. It doesn't start until mid-June . 

I explained to him that I let them know as soon as I could and there was a $100 cancellation fee. I asked him if there was anyway we could work around it. 

He said, ""I don't mean to be mean but it's business. You basically have two options, reschedule it for later this year, or call in sick enough to get points (and get fired). 

20 minutes after that I went to the schedule to see what weeks people were on vacation. The head tech said don't worry about it, she'll put me on vacation one week and we can schedule around the 2nd. 

(Note they have reduced our hours by 12 weekly)

The manager then went her directly, she explained we would be fine

Of course, Walmart corrected again giving me another

The delivery driver's will the items at your door w/o ringing the door bell, they take 10 to 20 steps back to get a far off picture and then zoom away with your stolen items that you purchased. 
Walmart really needs to do something about this.Sealing up the bags in some way that the delivery drivers cannot access your personal items.

Soon the real hell beings my teammates start grabbing shit off the line. I started grabbing boxes asking we're shit goes, soon I'm getting the hang of thing's but then our team lead says he needs to go and help other associates across the store. So he admittedly runs away with a pallet jack and leaves only three people to unload the truck with a broken line. This was supposedly a bigger truck then normal so we had little room to store stock on the paletts, it got to a point were the stock was on the floor and we couldn't even walk through the store anymore. When the truck was finished about 3000 items or more was on the ground. The team leads comes back into are corner of the store and displays the biggest soy face of disappointment, he was fuming, the team lead yelled at us for not doing our jobs and not telling him we needed more pallets and it was our fault for not being good at our jobs and whole bunch of other shit that doesn't matter.

3256,3256,Walmart,Just had the weirdest Walmart experience with customer service.,"Let me start by saying I’m 30 years old and I’ve never asked for a manager in my life. I greet workers, smile, and have wholesome exchanges almost anywhere I go.

A few days ago I purchased a bulb I didn’t need anymore (still unopened and sealed). Yesterday I purchased a car seat cover (also unopened) but saw a better car seat cover in the same store and wanted to exchange it. I had three other unrelated items I wanted to use my credit from the bulb and car seat covers for, then pay the difference.

I walk up and I tell the lady I have this bulb and a car seat cover for that I want to exchange for three other items. She tells me “We don’t do exchanges here, only refunds”. I was shocked as I’ve been exchanged other things before. I look at the sign behind her and said “It literally says refund or exchange any item up to 90 days with or without a receipt.” She said “I don’t know why it says that. Maybe with food in certain situations but we don’t do swaps here”. The whole time she was being snarky and rude. I didn’t believe her and for a second I thought I was getting pranked. I said “Ma’am respectfully it says it right on the sign and there’s also a paper right in front of me that shows the return and exchange policy and chart that says any item”. She blatantly said she doesn’t know why it says that. I asked if I can get it on a gift card and use it towards the other items and she said yes that’s fine. So for the bulb I purchased that was easy because I had the receipt. For the car seat cover I didn’t have the receipt and also my wife paid for it, she was at work so I didn’t have her card. The lady said she needs the receipt to give me the credit and I need to come back with my wife’s card. I chuckled and said “Ma’am the paper also says you can process a refund without a receipt with an ID”. She said “Sure I can do that”. It was their weirdest interaction ever and I felt like I was getting gaslighted since she was saying the sign isn’t entirely correct. Am I missing something she was talking about? I was so dumbfounded that I had to post the interaction here.

I clocked out at 12:07 which had me at 6hrs and 15 minutes of time worked for today. My coworker got back from lunch at 11:56 and our department got busy so I was tryna help out before I left. I spoke to HR before I left and they mentioned that I shouldn't even be clocking in 9 minutes before my shift starts, which I thought you could. I thought there was a rule where you could clock in 9 minutes late/early. 

Not sure if I will be coached because I've been clocking in 9 minutes before my shift like almost every time I work and clock out 9 minutes early, which brings me at exactly 8hrs. I thought it was fine? HR even mentioned it during orientation.

How is it not okay to clock in 9 minutes early, but okay to dump a 13hr shift on a 2.5-month associate lol. Someone help me make sense out of this.

Is the pay rate different for Walmarts in other states? Also what is working at Walmart stores like in larger cities like Columbus, OH and Cincinnati, OH and Indianapolis, IN and other similar places to those cities? I know with the bigger cities comes more crime but I’m willing to take the risk. I apologize if the locations are TMI but it’s relevant to my question. I’m just curious and am currently looking to branch out into other states outside of my own but need a job to pay rent so I’m sticking with Walmart so why not transfer one more time once my lease ends?

My reason for asking is because I currently make $16 an hour + my annual raise of less than $0.50, I’m also thinking about transferring to at least 1 more Walmart store but in a different state as I currently live in North Dakota and have pretty much lived here my whole life and I am currently making plans to move out of state in early 2025 which is when my lease for my apartment ends, but I’m not ready to quit yet.

3291,3291,Walmart,My Fellow Overnight Associates Inspired Me to Quit,"Just finished my last night working Overnight Stocking. Only worked 4 months, but it was the people I worked with that encouraged me to get out of there. And I don't think that was their intentions. 

I thought it was going to be a chill job where I could work alone, zone out, and listen to music or podcasts, but turns out my Walmart won't allow you to wear even one ear bud or listen to anything apart from Walmart radio and the unending rants of your fellow associates. 

I worked consistently in Papers/Pets/Chem or Frozen, and I was always paired with another associate. I guess something about my personality makes people think I want to listen to them rant uncontested the entire shift, because these people would often ignore the other associates, make a beeline for me whenever possible and completely open up to me. For example...

Our Team Lead who trained me (great tip he gave me was that you can use the topstock of other aisles to hide your overstock) had a habit of telling the most outlandish stories where he was always the hero. He was trained to box by the professional wrestler Adrian Adonis (despite Adrian dying when he was a kid), he put out a fire in the local KFC by throwing his body ontop of it, he was a star basketball player in high school and could dunk (he's 5'8 and consistently winded), he's set to inherent a million dollars from his parents when they die, and he has a fiancé in the Dominican Republic, whom when he visited her fought off several knife-wielding muggers. He's also writing a book on his life, so look for that in your local Walmart in the near future.

Another guy told he doesn't watch any anime or read any magna anymore because the writers don't know what they're doing, so he only reads fanfiction by people who actually understand the characters and the world. He thinks burping loudly is funny and does it throughout the shift. He once spent an entire shift describing the powers he would have in My Hero Academia and the role he'd play in the story, but says he doesn't plan on writing any fanfic himself or submitting this character for other writers to use. During break, he always eats a footlong sub and instead of cutting it in half, he'd alternate eating it from opposite ends. And his life goal is to save his money until VR technology reaches the point you can live inside and he can accomplish his dream of becoming a Honey Badger-Man hybrid.

Anthoer guy, who isn't as bad as the others, loves video games, but mispronounces every vido game title ever and is completely clueless on the industry as a whole. Continues to argue that Rise of the Ronin was made by the people who did Ghost of Tsushima, Nioh, and Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice. And will spoil everything about whatever video game he is playing even if you ask him not to, because he ""doesn't care about the story""...

And finally the old guy in the freezer. He also liked to burp regularly and thinks it's funny. He said the most perverted things, like calls taking a bathroom break, which he does every hour, ""playing with the sausage"". He has a perfect memory of every video game and movie he's ever experienced, and will walk you through an entire game or movie unprompted. Despite this great memory, he forgets what he's already told me consistently and repreats himself. Got a lengthy lecture from him on the difference between Jedi and Sith, and how it's more complicated than most people realize. He thinks wrestling storylines are real. He complains no one else working knows what they're doing and claims he used to run a whole Walmart himself. His catchphrase is ""Oh yeah!"" Only positive is half the time he's speaking he'll have his head in a freezer door where you can't hear him, so I'd miss half of what he said and he never once realized.

Every single shift, on every single hour, she has to “go to the bathroom” and it’s usually for 30 minutes to an entire hour. And I get it, shit happens, but shit doesn’t happen every shift, every hour, on the hour, you know?

 Her zones are absolute disasters every single night because she’s not on the floor other than the small amount of time she isn’t in the bathroom or on break. This absolutely tanks my department and me as the team leads come in the next morning and bitch at me for zones not being up to expectation. So, what do I do? Take it to the team leads? Coaches?

I have pto approved starting Friday, June 14 (until Tuesday, June 18). I noticed I was placed on schedule for Thursday, June 13. Since my normal days off are Wednesday and Thursday, I didn't expect to be put on schedule for either of those days. So I never requested time off for those days. I told my TL about this, and she said the system automatically put me on schedule for that Thursday since I'll be off Friday. I told her I needed that Thursday off because my flight leaves on Wednesday, June 12. So, my TL said to put in another request for unpaid time off for the Wednesday and Thursday of that same week, and for the Wednesday and Thursday of the week I come back. I put in the requests yesterday, but I see my coach rejected all of them today. The phone notice says to ""see manager"". 



Although I'm already off on Wednesday, June 12, my TL said to still put in a request for unpaid time off for that day. My schedule for the week I come back is not posted yet, but as of right now, she said I have to assume I'll be off Wednesday and Thursday and put in requests for unpaid time off for those days too. Requesting unpaid time off for days I'm already off is obviously unusual. It's like, how can someone approve unpaid time off for days I'm already off and not getting paid.

Anyway I notice all these posts and alot of them are people having to deal with customers or problems that only happen on the day shift.

I worked overnight at a store that wasn't open to customers 24/7.  Where are all the people that work over night stocking shelves?

I normally worked grocery, pets, toys, and seasonal.  

What are some horror stories you have from the night shift?  I'll let ya in on one... I never rotated product when I worked grocery.  At first I tried but that's when I noticed no one else was doing it and I'd get dinged for taking too long rotating.  So I'd just say fuck it and get everything out asap.

Also I've seen so much product destroyed by carelessness and I'd be lying if I'd say I hadn't destroyed anything... But the worst was this one time I saw my boss completely wreck a whole pallet of tomato sauce.

It was 7:05 and I had just clocked out and was still near the clock putting on my headphones when I notice my boss walk in pulling a pallet of juice.  He clips an overloaded pallet of Classico and the plast wrap was off and the whole thing fell down.

I looked at that mess and was so glad I didn't have to clean that shit up.  When I made eye contact with my boss it was the most awkward moment ever.

So, at our self-checkout, when customers pay with a card, it sometimes prompts them to enter their PIN. They can bypass this by pressing the red X (cancel).

I usually say, ""Oh, to bypass the PIN, press cancel,"" to which they ask, ""WHICH ONE IS CANCEL?!""

Let's break it down: there are 10 numbers, a #, a *, and then the red X, yellow arrow, and green O. Hmmm... which one could be cancel? I finally tell them, ""It's the red X, like a stop light.""

So I guess that's that then..


So my team leads pulled me, my bf and my best friend into the office on Sunday to let us know that they didn't like how much ppto we all had been using (I've only used ppto 7 times since February and I have  1.5 points). And said that the next time one of us uses ppto without proof of medical emergency, we would be coached. After we said it was against policy to do that, he sayed he'd just coach us for productivity.

The store tries to have at least 2 people working in produce each night. Sometimes when someone is supposed to help me in meats, my TL sends that person to produce if no one is there (maybe someone called off or no one was scheduled) or if there's only 1 person there already. So, I then have to do twice the work in meats. There have even been some days when I was told not to work in meats, but to work in produce because no one was going to be in produce from 1-10 pm. So, things like claims and donations piled up for me to do the next day because no one worked in meats. What pisses me off the most is that on some weekends, there are 3 people working in produce while I'm still working by myself in meats. My TL said it's all because produce is more important than meats. So more needs to get done in produce. I asked them to let me work in produce from now on, and let one of the produce employees work in meats from now on. Unfortunately, they keep telling me no. Is produce more important than meats at your store too?",1717000910.0,NEGATIVE,0.9957584738731384

I’ve read on the Reddit that we’re not actually supposed to ask customers to complete the survey I don’t know how true that is but my question is could I actually get coached, or even fired, for not wanting to do it?

3384,3384,Walmart,W or L schedule change?💀,"So for some background I recently just hit 3 months with the company as a full time associate.

I previously had Mondays and Fridays as my days off, which I didn’t mind at all because I like splitting the difference in the week. But this past week I showed up to work on Saturday as I usually would, and noticed I wasn’t scheduled. I talked to my TL to make sure it wasn’t a glitch with the Walmart app, and as it turns out my Coach switched my schedule without me noticing. (Which is 100% my fault as I should have checked my schedule ahead of time but oh well)

So now instead of the original Monday and Friday off, my coach has my days off scheduled as Friday and Saturday. I’m partial to both and have pros and cons for both, but I kind of wanted to see what y’all thought on the change.

(TL;DR Mondays and Fridays off switched to Fridays and Saturdays off. 👍 or 👎?)

# What is the site?

It's basically a site that has brief explanations for the points, a points calculator for absences, tardies or leaving early, and a point drop off calculator. I suspect the point drop off calculator, [Date Calculator](https://whenwillmypointdrop.com/date), will be of interest to most people that check out the site. You can add all your points and take a screenshot of it so you'll have all the dates in one image.

# Why create the site?

I noticed there are typically repeat questions on attendance issues on this sub and I get similar questions from co-workers, so I figured why not create something that people can access and help them out.

Again checkout [whenwillmypointdrop.com](https://www.whenwillmypointdrop.com) and let me know what you think. Any bugs, issues, errors, or wrong info, or whatever I'll try to fix and if there's any more information or features you would like to see let me know and I'll see what I can do.

Who I need to talk to request a change? I’m afraid to ask my coach or team leader because they don’t want me to move from my area because they know that I like to work hard and I always got my freight done and my zoning it’s goos, I have been working on juice and water by myself for about 10 months and when I’m on my days off they need to send 2 or even 3 persons to finish the freight that’s the reason they never move me from that area and it was told from them to me so this is the main reason that scares me to ask them for a change.

3425,3425,Walmart,Feel like I'm drowning and failing as a team lead ,"**TLDR warning**
I'm a hardlines team lead as of April. Since I started in April as a team lead, I feel like every single day, I can't accomplish my goals. We come in to unran freight and we are undergoing a remodel, too.
My bins are a disaster, and I can't even make time to get myself or my team to clean them up or ask for help from coworkers. Other shifts like overnights and CAP2 keep knocking my back stock over and blocking vizpick labels with other cases and management just thinks me cleaning it up, will fix it. It has been addressed in meetings and huddles. I even witnessed a CAP2 associate putting cases in the bins incorrectly and coached her by walking around the right procedure.
In addition, there is favoritism among my co team leads. My store manager and the coaches have some kind of grudge against me because my husband also works at the same store as me (he is in a different store area) and we have both had health issues we are trying to fix, and they retaliate if you have to use PPTO to take care of an emergency.
All of the consumables areas are buddy buddy with each other and always nitpicking my departments. GM and homelines are always behind. I'm down 2-3 team associates right now and the two strong ones I have are constantly being pulled to OPD to pick or run leftover picks that CAP1 can't get finished. I also have major zone issues in stationery right now because we always have hardware and sporting goods to catch up on.
I understand we are all struggling. But I just don't feel like I'm succeedjng or set up to win. There is a fire to put out every day. I'm trying my best to do what I can everyday and we celebrate small victories. I appreciate my team but my team is always upset they don't get to be in their areas because of our store struggles. And I don't know how to motivate them.  My dad just died unexpectedly and I was told during my shift 2 days after he died from a stranger. I didn't even get a sympathy card from anyone at the store.

My boyfriend applied to work up at the same Walmart as me, just different department. Did his interview and his background check last week. We knew for SURE he had one misdemeanor (interference w emergency call) from 2015. We did the background check, and had to answer questions over what happened and what he’s done to change, yada yada. We didn’t see on the report that there was a different misdemeanor that he has zero knowledge over for harassment (long story, but to sum it up, ex got pregnant and ghosted, he blew up her phone trying to figure out what’d happen to their baby, she filed a restraining order, he got a call from an officer and once he told the officer she was pregnant with his baby it ended there. no court dates, no fines to pay, no jail time. just told to not contact her again which he did not contact her). This happened in September 2022, but the county we live in (where she filed it) just put it into the online records system this January. Just shows 3 things all on the 11th, which in order are Complaint/Information(OCA), Capias Issued, then a Inactive Case Event(OCA). Since we didn’t know that was on there, he didn’t explain anything on that part of it. His background check report shows in the picture. Will they be able to resend a background check after we call the District Attorney to get the misdemeanor either removed or changed to dismissed from filed? Will he maybe even be still eligible to be hired? It went from decisional to what it shows in the picture. The system when I had our people lead look earlier showed a red flag but that red flag said information was still being reviewed. ",1716940683.0,NEGATIVE,0.9370620846748352

And I try that... but it stays like I selected it and doesn't do ANYTHING. Then I purposefully enter the password wrong, and it actually gives me something saying the password doesn't match the User ID. So I use go on ahead and do it correctly again... and it still doesn't work.

I’ll give ya a background-
I’ve been at Walmart for several months now. We’re pretty busy in my area.
I am in apparel and I’m pulled to Dairy/Consumables, cashier/frontend and ODP sometimes all in one day. Plus we had 3 associates get fired for calling off Memorial Day weekend. The other night I was the only apparel associate and I did fitting room and the jewelry desk all by myself. So my department and store is pretty screwed right now as we are in a summer time destination town so tons of people. 
I was interviewed and told that I have a job as a cake decorator in the bakery a couple weeks ago. Now I am not able to have the job, because we are critically staffed and cannot transfer 
I have been told by many other associates that I should have the job, because they are not allowed to bar me from switching departments. 
So, I wanted to if there’s a policy about this? 
I don’t see any way of me getting that cake decorating job but I want to know if I am still able to transfer to another department that’s not so difficult.
Let me know any advice for this situation

The only managers that have stayed the same are the front end(where i am). And i also find it funny how they put everything on us at customer service. My job should be to work customer service, money services, and self check out. 

But for some reason i’m working electronics, cutting fabric, helping ogp customers get their order, pushing carts, unloading trucks, and all over the store opening up cages for customers when there should be someone in every department to help. And half the time they don’t know where their manager is.

and i’m just curious, as a front end services Ta am i allowed to refuse working anything other than my job description because im becoming fed up.


OH and one last thing, i don’t even know if this is allowed but for the “metrics” they have the associates type in random numbers to have it say “item not found” to make it seem like there’s someone working the register when in reality they’re off doing something else. Or they’ll have us “encourage” the customer to engage in the 5 star survey or if they don’t click on it then we’ll do it for them. I myself don’t mention the survey to the customers because this store is shit.

I bought a cell phone online for store pickup. Got it home and couldn't get it to activate so got online with phone company. After some detailed back & forth between us the manufacturer said it wasn't scanned at the store. My account was charged and I have the confirmation number from store pick up. I chat online with Walmart because it didn't make sense to me. The online person did research and said to take it to the store to have it scanned. An upper management person and I believe it was the electronics manager made a call to someone & turns out the phone wasn't scanned in inventory & shows the store still has it (even though I have a receipt, order # from store pickup, a debit from my bank account and now, an incident number) The manager called someone who is authorized to ""scan* it and they co??uldn't say when they'd be in this store because they make their own hours. Chatted this information to customer service and they said to go back to the store*again*.

Thank you for reading, I tried to make it brief but have done a lot (I feel) just to activate a freakin phone. I'm also in hospital with 2 broken elbows so relying on friend to go to store. He's a chill level headed guy I trust. He documented what was said & titles of those involved.

Do I have hope to get my money back? The people in store didn't want to return it, saying "" Just call everyday until the scanner guy is there. The employees admitted it was their mistake even. Any advice? I'm close to just eating the $ and going elsewhere except I can't afford it.

3557,3557,Walmart,Changing billing info for online orders.,"I placed an online order last week with Walmart Canada.  On the weekend I received an email saying there was a failure when they billed my credit card and I needed to call their 800 number. Looking at the order I noticed an error I’d made on the address.  So I called to get the info changed so they could retry.  Agent said he could NOT change the info but they’d retry the billing in 24 hours.  I said “but it will fail again without a change”.  He said he couldn’t change the info and there was nobody that he could pass me to that could.  He suggested cancelling and reordering.  Ended up doing that, seeing no other way forward.

I just don’t understand why someone at Walmart can’t correct the error I made.  Why have a process to call 800 # if nothing can be changed.  As a result, and assuming I corrected all errors on the reorder, my order arrival date is two weeks later than original order.  Very frustrating.

Aside from double checking your billing info before hitting “Place Order” (DOH!) does anyone know if there was a department that could have fixed the issue?  I’m just trying to correct what appears to me as a broken process.

When one of the locations were shut down everyone was told their pay was not guaranteed and many had to take a 15k pay cut in salary after being displaced. 

Coaches sleeping with team leads. Store managers breaking all the rules taking a store from 120 mil in sales and 2.8 mil in shrink to 93mil in sales and 4.5 mil in shrink. 

One day, we found a literal human foot in the back of the building.

Associates doing it in the l&g closet. Associates pulling tricks in the parking lot. 

Meat department not disposing of claims. Expired meat Piled up into a 6x6 ft space. And I mean 6 feet tall. No joke. Congealed blood was 2 inches thick. 

Managers going out of there way to cut hours and do everything in there power to make sure someone no longer works with the company just because they don't like the way they look. 

During covid my coach told me I had to tell this elderly associate that they had to wear the sprayer backpack because it was coming from corporate. That thing was heavy as shit. Refusal was met with a d/a

Meanwhile all the benefits and incentives were taking away from long term associates. I can go on but I think Walmart lost its soul when Sam's wife died. Now it's a cancer filled with shitty managers that need to go and the focus needs to go back to the associates and the customers. Stop leading with fear. Actually care.

I worked every shift for this company. Often worked more than 60 hours a week. Always followed our core values. Led teams, improved stores, made great relationships, wasn't afraid to get rid of unethical bad managers than hurt culture. Said yes to everything that was asked of me. I did it all for the associates. I did it as long as I could. Eventually I had to quit for me and I'm better for it. I feel bad for all the associates stuck with shitty managers that lead with fear and work without integrity/ ethics. ",1716781891.0,POSITIVE,0.9846715331077576

3637,3637,Walmart,Asset Protection (API) / Loss Prevention,"For those curious about asset protection, here’s the case in a nutshell.
 
Asset protection is a very complex position when it comes to working at Walmart. To sum it up quickly, Walmart ties its hands behind its own back in terms of asset protection, and loss prevention efforts. Walmart expects you to act as an associate, law-enforcement officer, the judge, and the jury all at once for a couple of dollars over minimum wage, depending upon your area.

Walmart puts you in a position where you have to make tough decisions and criminally charge people for things when sometimes there is that chance that whatever it was, was truly an accident. Walmart will point you in 10 different ways, like expecting you to walk around in plain clothes and blend in, but then have you talking to your door greeters and checking emergency doors like any other associate which has you stick out like a sore thumb. 

Not to mention how weird it is when you have to follow around young individuals, male or female, because you suspect them of shoplifting, but now you look like a stalker and people call you out or report you to the store because nobody knows who you are (which is supposed to be the point). It is a double edged sword of a position. If you are someone thinking this is a good job to do before law enforcement, it’s not, Walmart has zero idea how to speak to anyone, and that is something you need in Law Enforcement. Walmart expects you to give someone the hammer just because they skip scanned a stick of deodorant. Also, if you’re law enforcement trying to transition out, do not bother in a role like this. I’d be open to answering any other questions but this is a hot take. ",1716762544.0,NEGATIVE,0.8161475658416748

Walmart should offer a free relaxation room where their customers can sleep, shower and eat for free during their shopping trip.

The room should have beds, a kitchen and a bathroom with showers. It should be free to use and the customers should be allowed to grab soap, towels and food from the store to use during their relaxation period.

I just really wanted to post this out on here. 

For preface I work in apparel and today there was only 2 of us working. (Except my coworker was on break so it was just me)

I was putting away returns and a man was looking at me, so I got a little bit self conscious. He was side eyeing me and licking his lips and I just ignored it. Until he walked up to me, and asked how I was doing, I replied with a good how are you? - he said good and kept looking at me so I continued to ignore it. 

He said ""I'm sorry I was just admiring your figure"" - I just said oh.. okay.. thanks? And continued working.

He walked away for a few seconds and walked back up to me and asked for me to show him where the men's socks were so I did, trying to do my job. I walked him over and it was just us in the isle. He then proceeded to asked me very explicit questions about weather or not I would let him go down on me, I said I have a boyfriend, that was apparently not enough to deter him. He continued on to ask how ""big my boyfriend was"" and tried to measure with his fingers in the air, put his two fingers his mouth and wagged his tongue in-between them at me, and I was just absolutely appalled, he then finished with ""are you hairy down there or clean shaven, and said okay I'm sorry."" .

I ran to a supervisor and told them. They called AP and got a good catch of the guy going out the grocery door on camera. He isn't a repeat offender at our store and they think he's just a passer by. I filled a statement and they gave me the option to press charges. I'm not sure what to do. I did say that he didn't touch me, or threaten to kill me so I didn't know if it was enough for the law to care. 

Everybody please just stay safe and don't just sit and take it. Please don't do what I did. I didn't know how to react. .... Aside from that if I had this happen to you would you press charges/S

One runs right up to me, literally inches from my face screaming ""that's my gatorade"" and snatches it out of my hand. He then starts posturing for a fight. I can see his friend filming what's clearly a prank. I roll my eyes and walk off as he's yelling at me. 

A few moments later I find a nicely dressed associate and explain the situation and she literally says, ""ignore them, they'll tire out eventually."" 

When I ask if this is standard practice she said it was ""easier to just let them burn themselves out than do anything about it.""

It usually feels like they're just as likely to stab you in the back than actually help with your issues.

Ok, so here's the **situation** I'm in (A bit long):  

Started back at Walmart recently - worked for a few years and then put in my notice (left on amicable terms, for some continuing education opportunity).  Back on full time, and my insurance benefits are going active next month.  The problem I've run into, after coming back to work, is that I've developed some sort of inflammatory response that my local doctor is wanting me to see a specialist about (swelling in the joints.  Started out small, hands and feet, but has progressed to ankles, hips, and shoulders).  

Rheumatologist is probably going to want to do MRI's and complete panels, which I literally can't afford without insurance so I've been putting everything off until June despite this all starting back in April.  But every day has gotten worse to the point that I can hardly walk anymore and I'm worried I may not be able to continue to work.  

**My question(s)**:  Will I still have an opportunity to pay for at least my first month of insurance and get coverage for the things that I'm getting scheduled in June?  Will I be able to grab COBRA if they determine I'm let go for not being able to perform the actions required for my position?  Short-Term Disability only seems to apply to those who have been here a full year (uninterrupted), so that's out.   Kind of stuck in a bind here.   I can start on an individual health plan without my employer, but at this point that probably won't start until July and I'd rather get the ball rolling on this.",1716643510.0,NEGATIVE,0.9964507818222046

However, yesterday she told me to go, when I wasn't feeling very well. So I asked if I ""had a choice to go or not to go"". And she basically said no. So i went anyways. My coworkers are saying she can't force me since I'm not a Orderfiller anymore. I went to HR and they said she can force me if the department really needs the help.

Well today, I was feeling much worse than yesterday. Hurting, 2 hours of sleep, and mentally I wasnt in the headspace to deal with all the bs in meat and produce. I would end up in jail for battery if I have to deal with assholes today. Orderfillers In meat and produce at my dc are at each other's throats all the time so... 

Anyways, I almost called in... but being that this is my new job, I forced myself to go In, but I just gave her a heads up that I won't be able to orderfill today like at all, hoping she atleast be a little understanding... and so she got mad and said ""soo, what your saying is you'll take the hit if it comes to it?"" And I just told her, ""I'm just going to have to the hit then.."" I told her that I got out of orderfilling for a reason, and I would like to get sent over, as least as possible, 

So.. then she said ""well, your just gonna have to deal with it, your new, and your old position hasn't been filled yet soo..."" 

I had been in the process of transferring for a month, and now it's been another month since I started this position. You mean to tell me they haven't filled my position in these entire 2 months? I call bs. But whatever...

My coworkers are saying I should take it to higher ups.. but I don't know if that's a good call. Are managers allowed to this?

Our Walmart is a super Walmart so we have a groceries side. About 3 hours into my shift I accidentally drop a customer change and apologize profusely and try to explain it’s my first day on the job. The customer and his wife berate me for like 5 minute with their groceries in their hands. I literally just stand there with my head down and grovel while tears are forming in my eyes. They leave and the person training me tells me to go on my lunch break. After my break I just bag people groceries cause I felt like shit and lost all my confidence. 

I’m genuinely so anxious about going back to work on Monday. I work night shifts exclusively because I go to school most of the day so I’m always working when there’s a rush of customers. The day of my orientation wasn’t bad since they just had me bag stuff but actually cashiering was horrible. I felt so overwhelmed with the amount of people in line and bagging everything by myself it was a nightmare. Anyway does it ever get better? How can I regain confidence?

If you cover at least half your shift that 2 point occurrence drops down to 0.5 points.  You do not need to use double PPTO (you literally can't for 8 hour shifts anyway because PPTO requests cap at 12 hours).  If you're late/leave early without using PPTO to cover it is still half a point.   You don't need an extra hour for your lunch if calling out.

3843,3843,Walmart,I got fired today.,"I left work early one day. In the past, I was able to put in PPTO within 14 days, and it would take off the occurence. 

I have terrible panic attacks that have gotten worse from working here. Been hospitalized for unaliving attempts. I've had these issues before walmart, but they got increasingly worse since being there. I've been there a bit over 7 years. 

Turns out that 14 day clearance is either a lie and I THOUGHT it was working, or it changed. I was told you need the ppto the day of the occurence. (Edit: Learned it's 7 days, also wanted to clear up that I put in the PPTO the day after I left early, not 7 or 14 days later.)

Part of me is relieved, the other part of me is in full panic mode. All I think is ""what now"", and how upset my mother is going to be. Yes, I'm an adult, but I still live with her. I have to pay rent and my insurance. And I'm already being extremely hard on myself. In 6 hours, I'll have her voice being harsh on me too. I just feel like a disappointment. She always told me walmart is easy, and says things like ""if you can't even handle walmart how will you survive"". And god I already hear her saying ""what do you expect to do when I die"". 

Sorry for the mini emotional rant. I also don't wanna say I'm promoted to customer, cause I won't be their customer lol. **Anyways it is my own fault for not paying closer attention.** I think I was looking at PPTO and PTO as a while, rather than just PPTO. 

Please wish me luck in finding a new job quickly! Hopefully an evil union company lol. 


Edit: This isn't me blaming anyone, as I already said, it's my fault, I'm well aware. Just overly emotional and needed a place to rant about work. I don't really have friends, and my family doesn't believe in mental disorders, so I can't talk to them about it.",1716573445.0,NEGATIVE,0.9989308714866638

Walmart can avoid this by bubble wrapping every single car as they pull into the parking lot.

The customer will return the bubble wrap as they are leaving the parking lot.

If any customer is a verified Amazon seller, they can keep the bubble wrap, but they need to leave their Social Security Number and a copy of their credit card with the associate so the store can garnish that customer’s income if it turns out that they lied about their Amazon seller status.

But I really hate how much Cumberbatch/Vincent drinks. I mean, OMG, dude, quit being so self-centered. I get it, you’re tortured. Yes, you’re a misunderstood artist, a genius, poor guy. I get it, this is the character; but, wow, the world is so hard for a middle-aged white dude genius. /sarcasm

I think Cumberbatch is the best actor for this character and Gabby Hoffman (so fantastic to see her working again!!!) is a really great foil. Dan Fogler as Lenny is another nice foil for Vincent. Where Vincent feels out upon, Lenny really is.

As Edgar, Ivan Morris Howe is such a wonderful casting. His face, especially his eyes, hold worlds. It’s not a big part, but it’s critical. 

I especially love McKinley Belcher as Ledroit. His character, he plays him as thoughtful and conscientious. The one lone good guy in a world of corruption and self-interests. He’s also tortured to some extent but it’s warranted, he is the total outsider just trying to be a good human, do the right thing; another nice counterpoint to Vincent’s self-involvement. 

I don’t know if I can stick with it, though, if Vincent doesn’t get his shit together. That moment between Vincent and Lenny in Episode Two…I don’t want to actually spoil anything but…wow, ouch, brutal. 

Is this just more nostalgia TV? Anyone have thoughts on this? What do you think of Cumberbatch? How about how he keeps talking to Eric and people barely react? And the B plot, Ledroit’s story…? ",1717284830.0,NEGATIVE,0.9878795742988586

It was supposed to run for 20 episodes but only 10 were released, and any source online I could find referred to the second half as unreleased.

So after much uncertainty, I went directly to the source and tried talking to the creator of the show Jon Iver Helgaker.

According to him the remaining 10 episodes were all but animated, with even voices being already recorded.

Sadly it looks like we won't get to see the rest of the story unless some other company or outlet decides to buy it and complete the animation.

3986,3986,Netflix,Just watched the Ashley and Madison documentary. ,"EDIT: Apologies, the title should state ‘Ashley Madison’, not Ashley and Madison. This is a documentary on Netflix regarding a dating site in which was set up for married individuals to participate in adultery. 


The whole thing has made me so angry. 


1. Sam and Nia seem to be obsessed with their online personas and would rather maintain online popularity than act like actual grown ups and protect their children by removing themselves from social media completely. They would rather continue ignoring the elephant in their lives by creating a mask on social media and sorting out their marriage. The environment they are creating for their kids is beyond me.

2.  I respect religion. But using the religion to hide behind the fact that you’ve made mistakes and in some cases, unforgivable things is a mockery to Christianity. They are taking advantage of faith by saying ""yeah I did this but it’s always okay because God forgives"". Yeah I’m sure God does but cmon? You are trying to justify the fact that you are allowed to do these terrible things because you trust in god? You are basically saying religion is giving you a license to do bad things instead of contributing to doing good. Sam, you cheated on your wife for years and the only reason you are sorry about any of it is because you thought you would never get caught. I recall Sam saying he never wanted Nia to find out about any of this and was going to take his secrets to the grave. And he would’ve only for the exposure of the online site. Where are your morals? 

3. The Ashley Madison Scandal is insane. However, the documentary was shocking. The whole documentary was based on victimizing the people who actually used the site to cheat and made the hackers out to be the people at fault. The whole message was ""yes these people did these bad things but oh, it was the people who released the data that created the problem"". No. The problem started when these married individuals made the conscious decision to sign up to participate in adultery. The documentary was totally biased in creating an idea that it was okay for these people to do what they did. Where were the wives/husbands whose lives were destroyed from these scandals? The multiple suicides from the exposure? I would’ve liked to have seen more of those topics rather pathetic men pretending to cry on screen over their infidelity and chatting shite about how they’ve ""redeemed"" themselves. 

4. These, primarily men basically refused to communicate effectively with their spouses on their needs and wants (don’t get me wrong, women were on this site too.. But the documentary was primarily about men and how they used the site). Instead, they just decided they were going to betray them and cheat on them. ""Marriage is hard"", ""you get bored"", ""I couldnt see myself sleeping with the same person for 20-30 years"" ok? surely you would've known this before you got married.. so why did you make a commitment? Have you ever tried talking to your spouse and having discussions over these subjects? You basically chose not to stand by the person you made lifelong commitments too and instead sought the “easiest” way out. You’s are victims of personal data breaches, personal information leaks, etc., but that’s about it. You’s all got what you deserved. These people are in so much denial, it’s frightening. These men were claiming to love their wives but are somehow able to justify cheating all in the same breath. 


Just my thoughts. Everyone is entitled to their own opinion. But this documentary made me absolutely livid.

So once a year or so I pay for a month of netflix and see whats changed.


- Wether or not they finally managed to adress the glaring user experience problems they’ve had for the past 15 years. 

-Wether or not we can finally sort by genre other than scrolling down until we may or may not find the genre we’re looking for.

-Wether or not the rating system finally works

-wether or not their media player runs the way it should

-wether or not the apps have mora than barebone settings like autoplay

-how greedy their subscription plans are


This time its been around two years since I last checked in. I am shocked to see a 4k plan costing 30 bucks. Their user interface is garbage as ever. Genre sorting still doesn’t exist. The player frequently gives me errors on pc and has trouble going into full window mode. Info pages on titles are reductive and incomplete. Buffering is really bad even on gigabit internet. Some titles are automatically in local language and impossible to change even when they for sire exist in english. Rating is still non functional. 

in short. It’s not convenient. I have a much better time downloading a torrent which in some cases will take less time to download a 4k movie than it is to launch netflix, wait for it to load, search for a movie (maybe find it), click on it, wait again for the info page to load, click on play and wait again, click on full window and wait another 20 seconds only for it to lag which will make me wait another 10 seconds only for me having to rewind to where the lag begun. 

This is unacceptable. As is getting an error once in a while. “oops something went wrong” is an error Ive gotten 5 times in two days. If this happens I have to reboot my laptop. A laptop that can render stuff in blender without problems. This isn’t a new issue either and Ive had it two pcs and a ps5. And forget about linux haha. 

So this major service provider just can’t seem to get their shit together. And until the user experience improves even a tiny bit which it hasn’t at all in 15 years, I will feel absolutely A-ok about stealing their shit. VLC player for the win.

They are adults who willingly put up with all the stuff happening there. There is no way that you wouldn't get what is going on when you join a fanatic ""church"" that basically keeps all of your income for themselves. 

A church that has you sign a fricking confidentiality agreement, and except for one guy, they didn't seem to bother, as long as their TikTok career is going strong.

The dancers only started to drop out once the accusation video was uploaded, so they probably feared the bad PR and backed off. 

From what I have seen, they could have dropped out at any point, but they didn't because they were afraid of losing fame and followers. 

So it bothers me that they were shown as total victims of manipulation when they basically knew what was happening but kept up with it for the sake of their career.

Keep in mind not everyone on the site was there for infidelity, single men/women could sign up and some people could sign up with consent from their partners.

There was some of it I feel like was justifiably leaked, like the fact the data security was sh\*\* and they were scamming people with a $18 delete fee that never happened. And the fact that Most men were being botted and being scammed out of money.And the creator was a sh\*t human. But someone on the doc compared to the users of Ashley Madison being similar to drug addicts and Ashley Madison taking advantage of their addictions. With that in mind, it feels like those same people where were like drug addcts are now being punished again.

TLDR: Ultimately I'm wondering, outside of the creator and the scamming, was leaking all the data about the users a net positive or negative? Arent they just victims as well or did they all deserve it?",1717038916.0,NEGATIVE,0.9982463121414185

Each character also has a score/rank. A characters rank is dynamically calculated after each game. It is calculated based on the consecutive guesses made by each player.

Let me know what you think.

4026,4026,Netflix,"The Betrayal of ""The Three-Body Problem"": Netflix's Unforgivable Misstep in Science Fiction ","I am beyond livid to discover that Netflix has butchered the extraordinary potential of ""The Three-Body Problem"" by announcing its cancellation after a mere two seasons. This is an outrageous injustice to what is arguably the smartest science fiction series of the decade. Cancelling now is tantamount to ending ""Star Wars"" at ""The Empire Strikes Back""—an unforgivable, butchered end to an incomplete epic.

Netflix, flush with our subscription fees and basking in the glow of their profit margins, has proven utterly incapable of being proper stewards of such a monumental narrative. This half-baked commitment not only undermines the intricate tapestry woven by Liu Cixin but also insults every avid fan who believed in the potential for a faithful adaptation. If they couldn't respect the source material and provide it the full scope it demanded, they should have passed on it entirely.

In the wake of such an egregious misstep, I can't help but lament how HBO might have delivered the justice this series so richly deserves. Netflix's failure has now driven me to the point of unsubscribing—firm in my resolve to no longer support a platform that so grievously undervalues the artistry and intricacy of masterful storytelling.

Or y'all just hate Jlo. 

I don't get it. I find it pretty funny and kind of a more interesting than the typical re-used AI vs Humans shoot em up trope that's been around forever.

Instead we get a smart but pretty useless lady in a giant mech with an AI trying to figure out how to work with each other to survive.

Yeah the intro to Harlan in the beginning is kind of clunky but what'd you expect in 2 hours? 

Personally I honestly love this movie and don't think it deserves the hate it's getting..

**Edit:** So after reading the vast majority of the comments here it seems my initial opinion of the hate was correct and the general consensus is it's mainly these three things causing the hate.

1. People who hate Jlo
2. People who have short attention spans
3. People who are salty because they got the wrong impression from the trailers

Let alone an ending for a series that wasn’t renewed. It’s even worse since it’s based upon the real events—and loosely follows them. 

As someone who’s lived a sex drugs rock and roll, psychedelic, nomadic, fringe of society lifestyle….gone to hippie music festivals, have “friends”—sort of, friends of friends really—who live and breathe that transformative, self sustainable, sort of communal, farm to table, homegrown yoga kombucha life,  made the 60s-70s psychedelia, turn on tune in drop out, classic rock/rnb funk, enlightened intellectual think for yourself question authority the basis of my identity….and a practicing christian oriented witch…… (is this enough qualifying….??? )

I absolutely felt similar vibes to Jericho and In the Dark, both shows I love but they also have the same awkward, almost soap opera feel to them. Then there’s the beyond tired Law and Order rip-off mixed with the equally played downward spiral, estranged couple, and yuppie skeleton in the closet trope….. as I initially stated this show was like an everything bagel, or a sampler appetizer, but most accurate would be a kids approach to the ultimate pizza sundae cookie brownie with cheese fries on top and all the sodas mixed together from the fountain on the side. 
The adult equivalent is the self serve DIY froyo joints that seem to have gone extinct.

When you’re in that moment, you are only thinking “ooh I like that and that and oooh yes some of that too….” You are not considering how the flavors and textures will go together. 

That’s how any show that seems to have been engineered using an AI algorithm to be a guaranteed hit would turn out

There are a few problems as it does not rate when you scroll too much but it's been very helpful to me

it is a very small extension and i thought that some of you may like it as i literally stumbled upon it randomly, this has very few subscribers despite being helpful as it has an instantly recognizable color code, pass your mouse onto the color and it will give you all of the ratings aswell as the average note for it

And then just like Game of Thrones season by season, every episode that passes it starts getting stupider and stupider. It takes GoT like, say, 4 seasons, and it takes this show like 4 episodes.

Why the fuck did they cut a whole ship to shreds? Even if the writer wanted to use some cool tech to get to the disk, isn't there a less stupid way to showcase that other than turning it into shredded cheese?

It felt like half of a movie the way it ended. Julia Roberts gave a dryer performance than the sand on the beach in the beginning of the movie. Honestly, besides Ethan Hawke and Mahershala Ali, all the acting was pretty lackluster and that's being super generous. The few minutes of Kevin Bacon was better than the rest of the cast combined, excluding those mentioned. The setting was all over the place (apparently you can see NYC from NC in this movie). The effects were on par with a TV show rather than a motion picture. Don't get me wrong, the premise was there with the whole cyber attack and then nukes dropping at the end, but the execution was so overwhelmingly poor that it completely killed the whole movie.

What I like is a series with engaging characters, a fairly complex plot, and if possible a bit of woo. The woo has to be carefully handled however. It's very easy to woo to take over a story and make it just so much supernatural blah-blah-blah.

Examples of mystery shows I've liked that hit all these notes includes Bodkin, Twin Peaks, the Dublin murders, True Detective Seasons 1 and 4 (I haven't seen 2 and 3) Arctic Circle (not any woo there, but still a good watch) and others I can't think of offhand.

I like stories where the detective is not subject to a harrowing horrible home life that leaves the detective on the verge of tears whenever they aren't investigating a mystery (lookin' at you, Broadchurch). If the detectives' personal life is a major distraction from the mystery at hand, I'm not all that interested.

A Disappointing Mess. Did they seriously snag a scene from Battle Los Angeles? , leaving audiences bewildered and underwhelmed. The blatant lack of originality is shocking, with scenes seemingly lifted from other films without even attempting to disguise the plagiarism. The storytelling is disjointed, the acting is uninspired, and the special effects are laughably amateurish. It's as if the filmmakers had no regard for coherence or audience engagement. Instead of crafting a unique cinematic experience, they've lazily pieced together a mishmash of clichés and borrowed ideas. Any potential for suspense or excitement is squandered amidst the chaotic mess that is Atlas.

4129,4129,Netflix,Deliver me: thought provoking Netflix miniseries,"Honestly, started watching the show for a quick night in. It’s only a 5 episode series so you can knock it out well. This was a very bleak watch.  I kind of predicted the mystery ending but I still was overall entertained with it.  

It’s gritty.  The two lead actors (the teen boys) played their parts very well.  One you love and one you hate to love but at the end of the day they are kids so you are rooting for them even when they seem to be rooting against themselves.  

The good guys aren’t always good and the bad guys aren’t always the bad guys.  My only main complaint is while the show is a quick watch, a lot of the episodes felt a tad repetitive and at times over the top to the point where you have to suspend disbelief.  Still, I recommend anyone who is into crime/gritty types of shows to give it a go.  Like I said I finished it in one night and it definitely sticks with you.  The ending especially.

4130,4130,Netflix,Thoughts - Toughest Forces on Earth,"I personally enjoyed the show despite it having its silly moments for sure and ridiculous moments I still quite enjoyed the show.

The hosts are former military service guys one being an Ex-Ranger another an Ex-Navy Seal and the last one an Ex-SBS and they’re pretty neat you can tell which one was in which unit before they really tell you.

The show takes course of 8 episodes where it’s different countries training with their elite units whether it’s Tier 1 or not it’s pretty neat. 

Some of the episodes were like “ehhh…” like the Malaysian one they were complete fakes it felt like they just wanted to show off but nonetheless respect to them. The Philippines and Swedish and Austrians are pretty neat it felt more serious to them and intense than the Malaysian like one so. And the Mexican special forces hid their faces for obvious reasons.

Other than I’ll give the show a good 7/10 or 8/10 it’s not over the top but not too scripted it felt like either. It is pretty dumb tho they only spend a week of doing certain trainings and then do some final mission it’s the repeat for every episode but different things so that’s a bit tedious.

I know someone posted about show already and in the comments was just a bunch of other men hating “I couldn’t bare to watch more than 2 episodes with how stupid it is” or “I did a tougher bootcamp in Boy Scouts than these guys” and like saying stuff about the hosts “the navy seal guy is such a clown” or the “the ranger seems like a tool” bro I was just laughing at how stupid the comments were like dude they’re real military service men or former servicemen.

I have a feeling all of the guys commenting in the chat which the show comments are fine but the ones talking down on the hosts are either ppl who have never been in the military or guys are just regular infantry and are jealous they don’t have the hosts track record.

You could argue it's due to how it's a preview and not the actual movie, but why clip that specific part where there's multiple swears?

Also. I haven’t seen the end of the documentary series on Netflix that prompted this yet, but, if people were blackmailing post breach, saying if they pay they can clear their name, that sounds like the breach was an inside job.

4169,4169,Netflix,Standard Plan vs Standard with Ads ,"Does anyone know what/how many shows and movies aren't available with the $6.99 standard plan with ads? 

I'm considering getting Netflix back for a while bc I canceled a few years back and there were some shows I'd started and watched a couple seasons of that I'd like to finish (Stranger Things, Sex Ed, Grace and Frankie, etc). 

I was aware that the price has gone way up and they've added ads but now that I was just looking at the plan options, the $6.99 plan with advertisements also says that some movies and shows aren't available. (Which is wicked shitty! but that's besides the point lol) But then the next plan up is like $10 more a month which does not all seem worth it to me. 

But if there is a lot of stuff missing from the $6.99 plan that wouldn't really even be worth it either imo, so I'm just curious if others have found it really lacking or if it's maybe more that stuff is just released a little later or something?

Thank you!",1716396902.0,NEGATIVE,0.9685767889022827

But when his Daughter takes over, there’s none of that. Characters don’t half-swear anymore, they don’t even say “Oh My God” or “Oh God” anymore.

I can't remember the last time I've been this excited to see the next episode of a show. It took 10 minutes or so to for me to tune into it's wavelength but when I did it was off to the races. I've seen people complain about Netflix shows having 8 episodes but at least in this case it fits. Also, don't take notice of the runtime of the episodes, each episode has credits that run for over 8 minutes (aaah, I get it).
Edit:-Just finished it. Man, the Koreans sure are sick (but incredibly smart and inventive) mother****ers. It gets veeeery 999 as it goes on but my eyes were glued to the screen the whole time. Now, this could go 1 of 2 ways, it could be the next Squid Game and everybody could be talking about it or it really could just fall by the wayside and fizzle into obscurity. I definitely hope it's the former.",1715948746.0,POSITIVE,0.9946341514587402
4279,4279,Netflix,opinions and analysis of RIpley TV show,"Hi, I just finished watching the series *Ripley* and I would like to share some opinions with you (there will be spoilers).

So, I really liked the series, at least until 2-3 episodes from the end. In the first half, I loved the style, the slow images, the black and white, the tension and suspense of a film noir, and the composition of the images in terms of objects and subjects. I liked that the series, for the first time or at least in rare cases, had actors speaking in English if they were American, otherwise all in Italian since it is set there, but with some devices where, for example, some Italians speak fluent English. In short, I was loving it, but by the last episode, I couldn't stand it much anymore and it saddens me because it's a series with style. I believe that some narrative problems already seen in the early episodes, as the episodes went on, grew considerably, leading to a rushed finale with many small lines opened and closed hastily and with several errors.

For example (I'm not going in order, but as they come to mind):

**Marge**: I just don't get her. She seems extremely in love with Dickie, but in the end, she starts flirting with Tom (completely unnecessary) and becomes stupid in her behavior. You'd expect her to have doubts (she was warned, she didn't get along with him) and to play a double game to understand who Tom was, but instead, she was genuinely infatuated with Tom and completely forgot about Dickie. I really don't understand this huge change in personality.

**Dickie and Tom**: Why did Dickie, if he wanted to get rid of Tom, take him alone in the middle of the sea on a boat 1500 km away? Did he want to get himself killed? You don't trust someone and you go together to an isolated place, without a reason?

**The detective**: He's a character I love, well-realized and wonderfully portrayed by the actor. Serious, intelligent, shrewd, and likable. Then he gets to the last episode and even he loses depth. An intelligent detective, who looks at details, who notices everything and makes appropriate conjectures and connections: he didn't want to personally verify Tom's passport, he never requested an investigation of his apartment (being a suspect) of Tom or Dickie, and on top of that, he goes all the way to Venice, sees Tom in person and doesn't question the fact that this man uses a wig, has the same voice as Tom and the same features as if he were his brother (light or no light, he shook his hand five centimeters from his face)? None of this makes sense. Moreover, he was looking for him so much, they gave him false leads, saying he was in Rome, he checked all the hotels, and when he meets him he doesn't solve the case by asking him in which hotel he had stayed after looking for him so much? Verify, don't find him, know he is lying. Instead, no. Then, why does he believe the boat story when the boat keeper had filed a report the same day? And what explanation does he give to a boat with blood and full of rocks that had been stolen?

**Why does Tom buy six train tickets when he returns from Palermo?**

**The private detective** arrives in grand style from America, already knows him, knows he is a scammer who changes identity, and when he talks to him believes everything Tom says, but what did he also get hit on the head?

In the last episode, all tension is lost, every scene that should make us jump out of our seats leads nowhere but to a dead end and a scene that is overcooked.

**John Malkovich**: Where did he come from? Casually in the last 20 minutes of the series, he goes to a dinner and he is also the stranger who always changes identity. What, two playmates found each other there by chance and without ever talking about it, they understand each other about what they do for a living?

In the entire series, no one ever saw a photo of Dickie? Even when they were on the table and at home?

The bank makes all that fuss from America for a false signature, then someone writes a letter and they believe it immediately.

Tom in the house in Venice introduces himself as Ripley, he has to stay there for at least six months and then disappears changing name and passport, how is that possible?

In Palermo, they recognized him after five minutes and no one remembers Dickie's face or in Venice no one recognizes him after months of newspapers talking about the case.

What is the time difference when Tom arrives in Venice (he already has a beard but it seems the day after) and when the detective receives the book?

**The Camorra guy**: He's there for two episodes, he's interesting, mysterious, and scary, and then he lets Tom walk all over him in three seconds and his only job in the series was to sell a boat? And the secret deliveries? And the art pieces?

**Dickie's family**: They come from America and for the English boy Miles, no one comes, this young man doesn't even interest his parents.

The night of the murder, Tom (I don't know how he transported a body standing up) drags it down the stairs, dirties everything, and then in four minutes cleans the entire staircase (or it was just slightly dirty after dragging a body by the head) with a single cloth. And the lady of the building believes they are mice? Mice as big as pigs? Also, excuse me, but here in Italy if someone makes all that noise on the stairs every three minutes, whether it's four in the afternoon, midnight, or three in the morning, you go there and look or call someone. He went back and forth (why didn't he take off his shoes for the noise of the heels?), elevator, doors, not even the lady of the building came out.

Moreover, the biggest of all: how long is the night of the murder and how does Tom go from the historic center of Rome to the Via Appia all those times back and forth if: the distance by car is about 30 minutes and on foot it is a good 1 hour and 30 minutes?

In short, I think this is a bit of everything that makes me frown and that, in my opinion, narratively creates a real imbalance and makes no sense. Moreover, the ending is really banal: wouldn't it have been better to catch him? Who really deserves a spin-off is the detective. Even the actor playing Ripley had no charisma, always the same expression, the same cadence in his voice, and that accent... for me, it could have been a 9 but it turned out to be a 6.",1715947887.0,POSITIVE,0.7393404245376587

4336,4336,Netflix,Ashley Madison doc,"UPDATE: I've finished the documentary. It's offensive. No real sympathy for the betrayed spouses whose lives were ruined. Far too much sympathy for the cheating men on the site (because the women were almost all bot accounts.) And way too much focus on the money-hungry ""Christian"" vlogger couple who are doing so much damage by advertising (because of course they wrote a book) that you have to forgive a cheating spouse because that's what god wants. Respectfully, fuck you.

I'm going to preface this by saying that my now ex-husband was not only a violent, abusive narcissist but also a serial cheater so when AM was hacked I immediately searched the data and was not surprised to find him listed. So, I understand that people are going to cheat regardless but jesus christ that doesn't mean you have to HELP THEM DO IT. Noel Biderman might be one of the most revolting people I've ever heard speak. EDIT: I wrote that last line before I knew >!he was also a serial cheater who asked escort agencies to send him barely legal teen girls and he'd ""choose"" one. I mean, I'm not surprised at all, but GROSS.!<

Here's why I'm making this post though - **some of these people being interviewed are actively gaslighting us as the audience**. Saying ""Ashley Madison taught me that the cheater is not the only one to blame.""

Yes, they are. YES, THEY ARE. I have no issue with open/poly relationships that are built on communication, honesty and consent - that's not cheating... but when your partner who has sworn to be faithful to you lies to you, goes behind your back and has an affair (emotional or physical) with another person that is your cheating partner's fault and ONLY their fault. Saying otherwise is so damaging for people who have been hurt in this way, especially if we've also been victims of narcissistic abuse.

I'm still in episode one, so maybe the doc will address this - but so far, the irresponsibility of letting that statement go unanswered needed a response.",1715784396.0,NEGATIVE,0.5231901407241821

Even the ""experts"" that give interviews or commentary seem to be dubious a resource more and more. Netflix usually displays the person's name and some blurb about what they are ""John doe, Yale University dept head of history""  something like that. 

Lately I'm seeing more questionable titles that at first glance sound legit, But on further review are pretty questionable as a source. Some have just been bloggers with no real credentials.

I know allot of us see different shows based on where we are so this might not be universally noticed.

4349,4349,Netflix,Question: Should I add an additional member or upgrading to premium?,"I'm in the US. I have shared my Netflix account with an elderly relative in another state for many years. 

When it was dvds I'd send her movies and shows I though she'd like since it's streaming I add stuff to her list. She likes this as I curate her experience.


I visited recently and we had issues watching at her house, I had to do text verification that I was there traveling.I hate that Netflix is doing this.

 I don't want her to do deal with this issue as she wouldn't contact me to do the text verification as she doesn't want to ""bother"" me. 

My question 
If I upgrade to premium does that resolve this issue or will we still have to text verify that I'm traveling to her house every 30 days?  I tried to make her residence the main location but it wouldn't let me.


Netflix seems rather vague about how this works but upgrading to premium seems cheaper than adding her to my account for $7.99 a month and requiring a new login for her, which I can't set up since I'm not there.

It was a drama/romance

I’m gonna try and give as much detail as I can remember about it.

The actor had almost shaved short black hair, the woman had brown hair. They were both in their early 20s.

There was a scene where they were at the woman’s house and in the pool.

There was another scene with her at work as a solider, she was in a watch tower with some other soldiers and they were (I think) watching something disparaging about Palestine, there was some sort of drama involving a phone…I can’t really remember.

There was another scene about him trying to cross a border (not sure which one) and being given a hard time by the Israeli soldiers.

I believe the man lived with his mom in Gaza, he had a friend he was always with.

The woman also lived with her parents.

It was a series, I think there were 2 or 3 seasons.

I can't remember how much we paid in the beginning, but I could swear it was $4.99/month at the time for 2 or 3 movies, or maybe that was the one movie option.  **If anyone remembers or knows what the price was back then would you please share that info** with me just to satisfy curiosity?  The earliest and lowest price I can find online right now is $9.99 a month, but I remember when it went up to $9.99 and had to think about whether or not it was worth keeping because it took a while to watch a movie, get it back in the mail, get another movie, watch it, get it back in the mail, and then get another one all within a month's time -- we're very rural in the middle of absofreakinglutley nowhere and the mail takes about 2 or 3 days longer each way for us.  It was still great programming at the time, and the added streaming was a huge plus, so we kept it and have been with NF since...more than two decades.

However, my kids are older now, the platform has greatly changed, and there isn't much on Netflix that interests me anymore, or rather, possibly there is but it is too difficult for my feeble old brain to browse.  There used to be a great site that had a database of most of what NF had, and it seemed to keep up with the monthly changes pretty well, but they haven't been doing that for a while now.  Looking at pages of huge thumbnails of what is immediately current is a pia.  **If anyone knows of a site that keeps track of titles (such as a database), then would you please share that link?**  Something like that is much easier to use.

I enjoy many of the foreign shows, but more and more of them don't have English audio dub.  Although I enjoyed subtitles in the past, neuro issues have now made it nigh impossible for me to read them while trying simultaneously to watch the show.  This genre is the biggest reason I kept NF after the database website stopped keeping the database.  So before beginning ponderations on whether or not NF is worth the $276/year, I'd like to better understand NF's steaming options.  Although my laptop and mobile devices are 1080, my TVs and desktop are 4K or UHD.  My ISP plan definitely has the ability to deliver the higher resolutions, but recently I saw a video on YouTube where this guy was talking about not getting 4K.   I stupidly didn't write down the title, didn't save or bookmark it, and now I cannot remember the title or the channel or the person so can't go back and find out what this was all about.   He did some digging and talked to NF and .... I absolutely cannot remember what he was saying, but it was along the lines of not only do we need to have the appropriate equipment capable of streaming and viewing 4K, but we have to also have the precise equipment that NF wants us to have.  Please do not ask me for details because I have no clue.  My memory has deteriorated considerably.  **Do any of you know about this 4K/UHD issue and needing equipment that Netflix wants us to use?**  I was thinking that if I cannot really get 4K (sometimes I know I do not but I thought perhaps it was just glitches with router), then perhaps it is not a big deal to jump down to the one device plan at 1080 since I'm the only person using NF in my family.  

If this is the case, then I'd like to compare the viewing quality of a 4K show, UHD, and 1080.  It is easy to find 4K, but when I search for UHD, I get the same 4K titles.  I'm guessing that this is because the vert is the same but not the horizontal?  Does anyone know?   But if I search for 1080, well, that doesn't really matter.  **Do any of you know of a show on NF that is not the higher rez's so I can use it for comparison**?

I'd really like to get this figured out before the next billing cycle, especially considering the fact that Netflix is expected to raise rates sometime this year.

Any help is greatly appreciated!",1715640058.0,NEGATIVE,0.9616037607192993

The line, ""Did it all happen because I was giving off some vibe I wasn't aware of?"" felt so realistic. The idea that predators choose victims they think they can groom and manipulate is insightful and disturbing. When that line was said, I thought it must have been written by someone with firsthand experience of SA or with help from a psychologist.

Once I learned the writer was also the person depicting these experiences, everything made much more sense. The story felt authentic and well-executed.

I tried everything I could have come up so far. uninstalling windows , using a clean Windows version instead of the HP bloated one, enabling HEVC addons etc pp. The laptop only has integrated Intel graphics. Intel shows HDCP is supported but is not compatible with HDCP.

4452,4452,Netflix,Ex’s account already on new tv,"I bought a new TV last year. One of the TCL mini LED ones with google tv instead of Roku. I never went into the Netflix app that was preloaded on my tv because, well, I didn’t have a Netflix account. 

Then one day in bed I accidentally leaned on my remote and hit the Netflix button. It brought up the account selection screen, NOT the login screen. There were four icons, all with names I didn’t recognize. I selected one and was suddenly just in the Netflix menu without logging into an account. I couldn’t, for the life of me, figure out how I was logged into an account already. After googling it and wracking my brain I gave up, deciding to not look a gift horse in the mouth. 

After like 4 months of free Netflix I decided to go to the setting menu to change something. This is where I found the account email. It was one I vaguely recognized, but I couldn’t quite put my finger on it. It was one of those first initial followed by last name emails and the last name is very generic. A few days later it dawned on me… it was my ex girlfriend from like 4 years ago. We had dated for like 6 months, if that. 

I have no recollection of ever using her Netflix account on anything I owned at the time, let alone knowing it’s login credentials NOW all these years later AND on a brand new tv. 

The only thing I could think of was maybe I did use it in the past and it was some how tied to my google account and when I logged into the tv it automatically signed me in? Idk. 

Anyone here have any ideas as to how this happened? I don’t use Netflix that much but, tbh, it’s kinda nice to have free Netflix lol. Hate to look a gift horse in the mouth again but my curiosity is well and truly getting the better of me. ",1715361501.0,NEGATIVE,0.9963580965995789

Last night, I just wanted to watch episode 4.  The cliffhanger pissed me off so I decided to stay up and watch episode 5.

Through the first half of the episode I was tired and felt like they were going slow.  Mizu's mom lived?  Mizu found a husband?  That's amazing, but what does any of this have to do with her current struggle?  I got the idea that the naginata would become relevant because of what was said about it helping when one is outnumbered so I thought, OK maybe that.  But how in the world is she going to get one where she's at?  They haven't shown her having one at all.

When she was removing her weights, clamping them together, and fusing them to CREATE A FUCKING NAGINATA?  Not only going into Super Saiyan mode without the weights but they combine to CREATE A FUCKING WEAPON?!

Also on reflection I realized how much I had missed what was implied from the flashbacks.  Her mom saying that she knew her daughter would be harder to catch while alone... more like she abandoned Mizu.  The mom's  'medicine' being opium and probably the reason she was getting with white men in the first place.

Mizu walking away from her dead mom and husband was incredibly moving.  Two people pretending to love her but abandoning her in moments of need.  You can tell why she is the way she is.

And then when Ringo and Akemi leave her as well which mirrors what happened to her in the past.  She did everything right and still people leave her.

It’s entertaining no doubt. There are for sure some awkward moments, but I think it was totally expected and he does his thing which is just generally really fun to watch. 

That said, the panelists have been a bit meh in terms of showing up. Don’t get me wrong John Stewart is also great at this bit, but it just was a bit meh, down the middle. And then with the awkward local experts (which, as a bit, are super funny in terms of an overall concept) are also a bit meh, but again expected and fun to watch Mulaney handle it. Nate Bargatze is awesome too and again the show is great overall, for what it is. Richard Kind getting better too as it goes.

Anyway Patton Oswalt was trying too hard and just generally not super funny, and taking a lot of air space.

4548,4548,Netflix,PSA- Ad Supported Plans Don't Work on Certain Devices!,"Just went through this and wanted to spread the word so no one else ends up dealing with this.

I usually get the ad-free version of netflix for one month at a time, a few times throughout the year to catch up on things. I hadn't finished some of the shows I was watching, and instead of pay full price I decided to get the ad-supported plan since I only had a few things left to watch on there.

I primarily watch Netlfix on my TV through chromecast. I've never had an issue watching it before.  
Once I changed to the ad-supported plan, nothing would play on my TV.  
Error code: AIP-703, R7111-1331

Meanwhile the ad-supported plan is advertised as able to ""watch on ANY device.""

When I contacted support, I was told that I would need to upgrade to watch on my TV.

I understand I'm using an older technology and there can be limitations. BUT I'm incredibly frustrated by the false advertising of the ad-supported plans claiming to be able to watch on any device when that's simply not true. I think most people would assume that if the ad-free version of Netlfix worked fine, the ad version would also work fine. I've never had an issue watching Hulu with Ads, or HBO MAX with Ads. This is the only time such an issue has presented itself.

I was able to settle the issue relatively quickly with support and get a refund, which I appreciated. The ad-supported plan isn't worth it for me, so I'll just wait til something good comes out on Netflix and spend the money to get the ad-free version. As mentioned, my customer service experience was fine and I appreciate them making things right by cancelling my account and issuing a refund.

That said, I really think they need to change their advertising and add an asterisk to ""any device"" or simply put ""most devices"" and allow you to check for compatibility before starting a plan. I can't imagine I'm the first person to experience this problem and it does feel deceptive in my opinion.",1715059689.0,NEGATIVE,0.9996201992034912

Ok, now that we have proof that it was on the service, let's talk about why I made this post. I have seen two post on the tipofmytongue sub that described a Halloween movie from said series and the two of them mentioned it being on Netflix in the past. A comment on another sub said they remembered the lost valentine's movie also being on Netflix before. I was wondering if anyone had any recollection of said lost movie, more concrete proof of it being on the service or if anyone had a DVD copy of it as this would help tremendously in my search for this piece of lost media and having a DVD of the movie would prevent it from becoming dead media.

only fix I think is working is me turning off the gpu acceleration on the browser that is stopping the crash - but is that a long term fix, is it better if gpu acceleration is off? Ive read mixed impressions on keeping it on or off?

  
I was really hoping to find the reason for the crash as its been bugging me for almost a year now

4573,4573,Netflix,Baby Reindeer Borders Normalizing Deflection/Victimization to the Point of Enablement,"Firstly, I want to say that men can - and obviously do - get stalked. No one deserves to be stalked. He does not deserve to be stalked. He does not deserve to be assaulted. He does not deserve to suffer. He does not deserve to be in fear or terrorized at all. Low self-esteem is real in men.

I know someone who has been stalked, and it's horrific. It's debilitating; she moved to another city, she reported everything to the police and they were limited in what they could do, but she was very upfront about it with the police. She didn't try to goad her stalker into sending a threatening email to her, she didn't neglect to report her stalker when said stalker (in reference to the show here) threw pop in the ex's face, she didn't neglect to report that her stalker sent numerous social media messages of threatening nature to a friend, and she didn't neglect to report said stalker cut her face with glass. But by all accounts, she did stand up to herself. Letting someone consume your mental and physical safety/peace takes more from someone than feeling like you ""lost"" from not reporting it to the police.

My primary concern with this show, and the post interview material he has published with ""stalking is romanticized as sexy on television, so I wanted to disrupt that media"" concept, coupled with the first few episodes, seems like he's asking people to sympathize and excuse a lot of these inactions simply because he wasn't courageous enough to do so. Yes, his confessional monologue gives some insight into why he cowers from it, but it feels more like he's deflecting than genuinely taking responsibility to his own inaction, and how he never even really seemed to get help from it (which he certainly needed), but rather greatly profited off it. He writes about these awful experiences, wins an Oliver award for it, then Netflix buys the show, he writes the show, stars in it, and in the last episode as he mentions, launches his career. Then he returns working with the man that drugged and repeatedly sexually abused him? That is a conscious decision.

Stalking really is awful, and it should never be seen as this ""romantic endeavour."" It's cracked that anyone thinks that show is ""sexy."" At no pint should stalking be portrayed as such. I hope no one gets stalked in their lives, but if they do, I hope they know inaction is, in fact, letting them win. You have to do your best to protect yourself and continue your life the best she can.

Victim Blaming is saying ""oh, that woman was asking for it,"" when she is raped because she wore a tank top, or she drank too much. Victim Blaming is saying ""he shouldn't have taken those drugs that knocked him out so much,"" when he's raped or sexually assaulted. Those assaults are real. They exist, they're not void. It is the victim's responsibility to fight for yourself, and selling/creating media that doesn't acknowledge that straddles enablement.",1714981545.0,NEGATIVE,0.9842349886894226

Spoiler (I doubt anyone would watch after all the reviews tho) but i did finish the series.

Honestly, im not sure what the series is aiming for specifically. Since there are million things happened at once…

First, what I was confused about the whole series is that why would there be a human trafficking happening? Well the cult thing sure made a little sense but what da earth is human trafficking in there??? And especially the place where they kidnaped all the girls to do the segs work. It doesnt make sense because they had literally a whole year to evacuate but all the people decides “we should start kidnap kids and do business before the asteroid hit the planet (in which Korea is the bullseye)” 

Second, i dont get why they all felt helpless when there is safe zone. Well tbh, other country would have accepted refugees in this situation. But they went as far as to create cult just to board the airship to the US that will crash for absolutely no reason.

There's one story line I don't get. Conrad Croker (Jeff Daniel) has a secretary (Chante Adam's). Whose husband - named Conrad in the show - has an altercation with Atl police over a parking ticket. 
At the time of incident (I think Ep 2) his car is pushed into a zone with no parking. Hence the police ticketing car and a tow truck about to tow vehicle.
Officer is white and Conrad is black. 
After the officer pretty much throws the character onto car purposely hitting him in back of head the character (Conrad/Husband of secretary) assaults officer. That then spirals out of control after incarceration pending trial and Judge pretty much not listening to lawyer. 

This story line seems disjointed from the broader plot between Croker (alleged billionaire real-estate mogul) and bank. And has gone on for at least thru Ep 5 which I'm on.

I've browsed the other posts regarding subtitles but none quite reflect (that I could see anyway) what my issue with Netflix is. Please forgive me if this is a tired post and people are over it and please point in the direction of a solution. 

Anyway, the other night I was watching The Martian. Having seen this in the movies and having it on Blu-ray, I know that when it goes to the Chinese space agency, when they speak mandarin (again forgive me if it is not mandarin), it is subtitled. Yet, on Netflix, there was nothing. 

To fix this I had to turn on English subtitles, but this gave me subtitles even when people were speaking English.

I was wondering if there was a setting on Netflix, where I can get it to give me the English translation when English is not being spoken, but not when English is being spoken?

Also it doesn't take anything in the story seriously. You never have a sense that anything is at stake in the story. 

Still, it has a goofy charm to it. I would describe it as not so much a parody or a satire, but an alternate world story. I felt that I was watching a version of the sixties that never happened. The divergences from our sixties were consistently goofy and strange in a relaxed kind of way. It's a mildly pleasant ride that you can watch with one eye on a tablet or a phone and have a perfectly good time while doing so. Maybe browse Reddit or something.

I called Dan at Netflix Customer support, he verified that there was an update and it would no longer permit viewing of Netflix on that Television.   The call was made at 1:58 PM on their computer system.

Dan volunteered that the TV was still capable of viewing Netflix, but I would now need a device like Roku or something else.   I asked Dan to send me the device.  Netflix rendered my viewing inoperable this is a way to fix it, I was ready to give Dan the address and he said that I would have to buy the device

Dan and I were getting nowhere so a supervisor/manager Lauren took over the call

I informed Lauren that there was no notice of the update.  Lauren corrected me and said that a notice sent out on the device.  I informed Lauren that I had watched the device everyday for the last week and there was no notice that I viewed.  Lauren informed me that there was supposed to be a notice

Lauren said In order to provide the high quality that Netflix aspires to, that it will no longer be available on the Samsung device.   It is Lauren's position that not being able to watch any videos on the device is providing high quality for this customer.

I asked Lauren if I was watching the videos yesterday and they were clear and the audio was good.  and today if I'm unable to watch videos what quality did I have yesterday?   Lauren said  Yesterday I was getting  high quality.   And she also said that today not being able to have clear video and good audio was high quality.   I informed Lauren that I was confused about Netflix ideas about high quality.

Lauren informed me was that this update would provide high-video quality in the future.   I asked her what about high video quality now - I reminded her that there was no video and no audio.

She informed me that I would have to buy a new device in order to enjoy the high quality in the future.   I receive cable television on this device.   I receive Prime on this device.  I receive Paramount plus on this device, and I receive Hulu on the device.   Up until yesterday I received Netflix on this Samsung  device.  Today I do not, and Netflix is aware that they rendered these device(s) inoperable.

I asked Lauren for the address of the legal department, her predecessor Dan had been unable to get it to me.   She said she would send it to me by e-mail.

Query has anybody else had the same type of high quality visited upon them as this Netflix user?

I parted with does Netflix intend to do anything to remedy the situation.  Lauren's answer was they intend to do nothing to remedy the situation.

Lauren agreed that Netflix has chosen not provide the device to its customers and that is a business decision.

Ideas?

4622,4622,Netflix,Baby reindeer is a terrible show that has let a horrible human become famous. ,"If you criticise Richard Gadd as being a selfish desperate attention seeker for leading a clearly mentally ill woman on, the common response is “victim blaming.” 

Yes I actually think we should all blame Richard for being this type of person to begin with. Knowing Martha was nuts yet still dragged her around because of the attention she gave to him. No one should believe he just “felt bad for her.” That is the easiest cop out answer you could use. 

This show is all around terrible, everyone in this show is insane. It’s a show about bad people butting heads. It literally means nothing. Richard has gotten what he always wanted and people have eaten it up. I don’t feel sorry for a person who gets themselves into these situations out of their own selfishness.

There were just so many things he did “wrong” that it was difficult. Especially since he had such good friends and family. Obviously he was very weak inside and scared but what made him like that?

Netflix hired a bunch of crooks and they are abundantly aware of it. We’ve been calling for months to tell them they are still charging her and nothing is being done. Netflix is disgusting for taking advantage of an elderly woman. I’m still in disbelief of what I witnessed.  They were intentionally trying to confuse her.

I stream anime on my very expensive 4k 32in, 240hz monitor using windows 10 Netflix app, with HEVC; slightly fuzzy.


I see someone else's stream on Netflix using a macbook/iPad and anime looks stunning.

I stream anime on Netflix using a 5 year old 4k tv from PHILLIPS and It looks good????? 

This is driving me crazy, I've googled countless times and no one can give a straight answer on why the sharpness and quality of anime varies so drastically across displays?

Like come on bro, two 4k displays streaming the same anime should not look this different, especially considering the worse one is legit top of the line.

Godddd

Edit: Tested streaming with Windows computer with HEVC and fire stick.

4K streaming looks notably better on a streaming device or TV than any app on a Windows computer.
Even when both are streaming at 4K, the streaming device looks way less grainy, and soft.

4642,4642,Netflix,Dead boy detective: a fun quick watch ,"It definitely was a fun quick watch.  It doesn’t take it self too seriously but doesn’t try to be anything other than campy cheesy fun but it does have depth. 

For someone who is not familiar with the comics, the sandman or doom patrol…..I decided to watch this over a course of the last couple of days.  

Admittedly because the two male leads are cute but honestly it wasn’t that bad.  

It definitely was more on the teen/cw vibes of things with the camp but shockingly it didn’t hit cringe level too often.  

The two male leads are phenomenal actors for their ages and characters and while I didn’t care for the female lead character I will say it is good to see proper representation of a woman of color who is allowed to be badass even if I find her character annoying. 

The balance in humor and banter mixed perfectly with themes of abandonment, abuse, trauma, infidelity, sexuality and acceptance.  

I’d argue this is probably the best Netflix adaptation for a teen show only because the characters realistically act like teens but it’s not over the top melodrama like something you’d see on the Cw. 

My minor issues is that while the two male leads are incredible….the two female leads come off as weak and it makes it hard to care especially when they try to push crystal to the front.  

Thankfully, around episode 5 or 6 they stopped heavily leaning on her and focused more on the dynamics that were stronger.  

The way that it ends is perfect for a one off.  Not too bad of a cliff hanger but also if it gets a renewal it sets the groundwork.  

I definitely will be back.

4674,4674,Netflix,Rationalizing away my quibbles with Ripley...,"I'll start by saying that Ripley is the most gorgeously shot television series of all time.  Hit pause at any single moment during the series 8 hour runtime & you have an image that is worthy of a spot on an art gallery wall.

What bothered me as I watched the series was Scott's performance.  There is not a single moment where the character shows anything that would be perceived by any person as genuine.  There is no charm, no warmth, & little if any charisma.  Marge and Freddie IMMEDIATELY key in on this, but Ripley mostly gets a pass from everyone else.  

As I reflect on the series more; I actually think it works.  This isn't the ""real"" world of blue collar folk.  This is a world of the uber wealthy from Fitzgerald's Gatsby.  Tom's ability to blend in (to the extent he does) is because his sociopathy is not so different from the vapid characters who we expect in those circles.  He is able to exists socially with these people not because he hides his true self, but because his true nature is barely distinguishable from their facades.  Tom wouldn't last 5 minutes in Manhattan, Kansas.... but once in the orbit of the elite, he can grift indefinitely so long as fate and luck are on his side.  

I can even use this to explain away the one scene that most strained credulity for me.  Ripley adorns a wig and masks himself in dim lighting to deceive the detective who has met him numerous times.  But he makes no attempt to modulate his voice or change any mannerism he has.  How does he get one over on this inspector?  I think it's that he's American.  I believe his voice is less distinct to someone who isn't a native born English speaker.  And his mannerisms just seem appropriate to an entitled trust fund guy.  It's stretching a bit to make it work for me, bit it's a good enough reason. 

On the whole, Ripley is a visual masterpiece and and outstanding example of building tension.  Long scenes free of dialog show an advantage that the small screen has over its big brother.  We are allowed to explore this world in painstaking detail.  Actions too mundane to be included in a theatrical film are allowed to play out in their entirety here, adding layers upon layers of depth and a mounting sense of dread.

I never heard of the Netflix Home Network until yesterday.  I just searched on this subreddit and see posts going back months.  What made Netflix enforce this change?

Wife & I were at the gym.  She tried login to Netflix to watch something and was told she didn't have access.  I tried on my phone, as the primary account holder, and found the same message.  We attempted the temporary code and that didn't work.  So no Netflix watching at the gym for the Wife.  

Got home and looked into it further.  See that we had to go on our TV and setup Home Network through Netflix on Roku.  OK, did that.  Then see we have to go on each device and stream for a short bit to authenticate those devices.  Did that, seems like all is well now.

But WTH Netflix?  This seemed to come out of left field.  Not being able to watch when we are paying $$ for the service is really irresponsible.  Kinda want to demand a refund even though it would probably be like $0.25.

Pixar and WDAS needs to step up their game or it’s (I’m so sorry and I really hate to say this, but) the end of them! Disney needs to either make a hand drawn animation film or another hybrid film. And Pixar needs to try something different with their CGI. I know they’re doing sequels and they will most likely be a box office success, but whenever they do something original, they need to try harder with their animation. Yes, WDAS did a a hybrid film with Wish and I really do love that film, but sadly, the critics and people hate the watercolor style. The watercolor style is a good try, but WDAS needs to try harder to make their hybrid films more spectacularly artful. Like why not try it with Meander animation like they did with Paperman and Feast. Or try it in Klaus style.

4720,4720,Disney,"Addison Wells: An Unseen Mary Sue, Inspect.","Hi.

If anybody Is reading this, which I highly doubt, I would like to address something.

If you have watched all of the Zombies! Movies, you are aware of who Addison Wells Is.

Allow me.

Addison Rosalind Wells Is the daughter of Mayor, A-Mishanta ""Missy"" Wells and Dale Wells.

Addison has a welcoming, accepting and ambitious personality which you'd expect. 

And I do not like her. 

Why? 

Mary-sue.

She's an unseen Mary-sue though, so many do not have any negative opinions or outlooks on her.

A mary-sue, a female character with little to no flaws, very nice and accepting. She Is ""overpowered"" and everything goes her away no matter.

She has everything and will be grateful.

She holds no hatred, she tries her best to see the ""good"" which makes her seem like she wants to be so desperately different.

Which is Addison, mind you.

Addison was born with naturally white hair, she has a fear of getting ostracized for her hair.

She wore a blonde wig until she confidently removed it in the ""I'm Gonna Stand"" song. 

She had revealed it to Zed firstly

Zed Necrodopolis is a Zombie. 

Zed, like other zombies, fully comprehend the feeling of ""not fitting in"" and he's fully aware he'll never belong, he fully accepts that.

Of course, he and his species got ""accepted"" later on but here comes my rant.

Addison has this deep, passionate fear of ""not fitting in"" since Seabrook's whole premise Is that you fit in, you blend in easily.

And Addison ""knows"" how it feels to be left out and feeling like you'll never belong.

Firstly, no the hell she does not!

Addison THINKS she knows the feeling of ""not belonging"" because of that white mane she has. 

It does not take a damn genius to figure out that humans are the accepted, Zombies are the dejected and they can hardly get along.

Pale skin, natural green hair, an appetite for literal brains and can activate true, carnivorous and monstrous behavior? 

Yeah, that sounds pretty Inhumane.

So, you can see why the Zombies are not accepted and people treat them like freaks.

They're supposed to be the ""freaks"". 

They may not like it but the Zombies clearly want to fight for a change, a revolution since they clearly hate getting treated like outsiders.

Oh no, but Is the movie solely on them?

No.

It's about poor little Addison and how she'll never feel the temptation of belonging and fitting in.

...

Do I need to explain this? 

Addison does have white hair, yes.

But so do the goddamn werewolves.

The zombies have actual green hair, you get white hair in your old age so not that uncommon.

Why does she feel a need to be so different?

The people in Seabrook try SO HARD to carve a place in their hearts for Addison to fit in but this brat Is not having that.

""Nobody will ever get me.""

You literally only have white hair.

She does realize hairdye exists, right?

If she went to school with her white hair, people would NEVER automatically assume that was her natural hair color the way they do with zombies.

Because all Zombies have green hair naturally.

The werewolves have literal WHITE strands.

Willa, Wyatt, Wynter.

All of them! 

Oh, but are they ostracized?

No! 

People would assume that was platinum blonde hair at best.

Platinum blonde looks remarkably identical to white hair.

In my opinion, Addison is self-centered, even moreso than Bucky If I may.

Bucky Is very clear about his narcissism and self-centered attitude and bad perfectionist personality but that is nothing to compared to his cousin Addison.

She gets on the cheer squad.

Her cousin being her cousin gives her an advantage to stay on the squad.

She becomes the cheer captain eventually.

She got to meet wolves and was thought to be their leader.

She ""took justice"" and went off about how ridiculous It is to hate on someone just because they're different from you.

She is the only one to suspect the aliens may be their friends.

Then, It gets revealed she's part-alien.

She LEAVES her home, boyfriend AND cheer squad all for a family she JUST met!

Addison, what the hell?

Just what the hell? 

You hardly even know these blue-haired bozos but you're like ""I finally found where I belong"".

You barely know them! They hardly know you!

No, you did not find where you belong.

You only want to FEEL like you belong somewhere.

Also, Missy could've helped.

Missy was fully aware her daughter was having a crisis and a fear of being ostracized due to her hair.

And literally did nothing.

Missy, what kind of mother are you? 

And you reveal your hair when your daughter Is about to leave?

She's ""found her place"" now Missy.

Next time, be a good mother and do better. You are literally the Mayor.

Also, I'd like to state something.

When she pulled off her wig, nobody really gave her a reaction.

Their faces pretty much said ""Okay?"" And that was that.

I bet they were thinking this girl literally pulled off her wig only to reveal pale blonde hair.

And for the rest of the movies, Addison looks like a regular girl with regular platinum blonde hair.

Nothing out of the ordinary.

Even after revealing her hair, she STILL feels out of place!

Like, what?

All this girl ever wanted was to do cheer and not have anybody find out about her natural hair.

Everybody doesn't really mind or seem to care though.

And she still feels like an outsider...

Addison, you are not a victim! 

Zed is a victim!

He and his other zombies have had to deal with constant harassment, hatred and mockery ever since they came to be.

He does not try to get ""accepted"", he wants to play football and he tries his best to make sure things can get better for him.

No, It's all about you, you, you!

You are not a victim!

You're such some girl who has this false mindset of everyone will hate you for a damn haircolor! 

People literally adore you.

You're so self-centered and you want people to come crawling at your side and be like ""Oh no, I accept you! You'll find your place!"" 

It's not like you were ostracized for it either.

So, why do you still have this burning passion for being different?

Some girlfriend you are.

Some friend you are.

Some daughter you are.

No, some PERSON you are.

In conclusion:

I do not like Addison Wells.

When you look really closely, you can she is a mary-sue.

That was all.

If you like Addison, kudos to you!

I won't stop you from liking a character I cannot bring myself to like.

That was my opinion of Addison from Disney's Original film, Zombies!

Thank you all.

4727,4727,Disney,Native girl - White man trope,"As a Native American, I find Disney’s representation of Native people frequently falls short. While I believe “Brother Bear” was a positive portrayal, the depiction of Native American women in Disney films is particularly frustrating. They are consistently oversexualised and portrayed as pining for white men. This can be seen in “Pocahontas,” “The Road to El Dorado” with Chel, “Peter Pan” with Tiger Lily, and more. Chiefs are often shown as angry and hostile, while white men are depicted as saviors. For instance, in “The Road to El Dorado,” the protagonists deceive the natives into thinking they are gods, and Chel not only keeps their secret but also dates & runs away with one of the Spanish con artists. This trope is infuriatingly prevalent in any animated depiction of Native Americans, such as in “Asterix Conquers America.” I am deeply frustrated by the recurring trope of the “cute native girl, angry native man, and white savior.” This narrative is not imposed on other nonwhite characters in Disney films like “Mulan,” “The Princess and the Frog,” “Moana,” or “Aladdin.” It’s disheartening and offensive. I yearn for an accurate portrayal of Native women in Disney films, and if they can’t achieve that, they should refrain from creating Native American characters, especially Native women. It always demonises my culture & people. I also DON’T want them to race wash a character for this. Turning white characters into POC characters is so STUPID and LAZY. I don’t even understand how people connect with a character thar has absolutely no similarities to them at all besides how they look. I don’t even feel represented by actual native characters because they’re so inaccurate to indigenous peoples & culture & it’s just how non indigenous peoples view us.

4729,4729,Disney,Why ‘Treasure Planet’ is the Hidden Gem of Disney’s Vault: A Space Odyssey of Steampunk Splendor!,"Hey Disney aficionados,

I’m about to drop some truth about the most underrated Disney movie of all time: “Treasure Planet.” This isn’t your typical fairy tale; it’s a space-age odyssey that deserves way more credit.

First off, the steampunk design in this movie is out of this world—literally. It’s like someone took the coolest parts of the Victorian era and shot them into orbit. The gears, the gadgets, the gizmos—it’s all so beautifully crafted that you can’t help but wish you lived in this universe.

The animation is absolutely stunning. It’s like the animators were handpicked by the gods of artistry themselves. Every scene is a masterpiece, with such fluid motion and intricate detail that it feels like you’re watching a dream come to life.

And let’s talk about our main protagonist, Jim Hawkins. This guy is the definition of a relatable character. He’s not some prince charming; he’s a kid with a dream and a heart of gold, trying to navigate the galaxy and his own personal demons. We’ve all been there, right?

Now, here’s the kicker: “Treasure Planet” doesn’t lean on a love story crutch. Nope, it stands tall on its own two feet with a tale of adventure, self-discovery, and the true meaning of treasure—and it’s not just about the gold, folks.

So why isn’t this movie getting the love it deserves? It’s a mystery for the ages. But today, I'm setting the record straight. “Treasure Planet” is a cinematic treasure that’s worth its weight in gold and then some.

Let's give ""Treasure Planet"" the recognition it deserves. And if you haven't seen it yet, what are you waiting for? Go watch it now! Trust me, it's a trip worth taking.",1717093165.0,POSITIVE,0.9997493624687195

4741,4741,Disney,Disney Ratatouille ride vs Scooters,"Before I am called out for being against the disabled, I want to note I have nothing wrong with those who choose to use scooters within the Disney parks. Walking them is not for the light of heart. However, certain rides i’ve noticed have been repeatedly “ruined” for a better lack of choice word. Rides like Space Earth and Ratatouille, which are continuous rides. When scooter users board the ride, it takes longer which is okay yet it ruins the experience for other users on the ride as it stops it. 

The Ratatouille Ride is a video movie displayed on the screen which pauses when someone with a disability scooter boards the ride. The audio and the video is then out of sync for the rest of the ride experience. Considering my family and I waited for hours to board certain continuous track rides, it began to become overly frustrating.

4750,4750,Disney,King Magnifico was never meant to be a villain in the film's beginning,"Remember when Disney started the campaign to humanize villains? I think that's the case here. I haven't seen the movie, so I'm not going to judge it or say it's bad. It seems to be one of those movies that gets a lot of hate, but I might like it if I watched it because I often enjoy movies that others criticize.

I believe King Magnifico was never intended to be a true villain. People might be upset because they expect a moral lesson, but I think this movie was created purely for entertainment, celebrating Disney's 100th anniversary. It includes many references to other Disney movies, and its purpose might just be to entertain rather than teach a lesson.

King Magnifico is not an anti-villain; he's a powerful king with an ego. At the beginning of the film, he's portrayed as a reasonable person. Disney creators are clever; they know what they're doing. Typically, Disney villains are either evil from the start or have a twist reveal. King Magnifico seems to become a villain due to outside influences, like dark magic, which he turns to in order to eliminate perceived threats.

Initially, King Magnifico is shown as a good person with noble intentions. His transformation into a villain is gradual, influenced by external factors like the dark magic book. This change highlights his internal struggle, reflected in the song ""This is the Thanks I Get."" The song lyrics suggest he feels unappreciated despite his efforts for his people. The lyric video even uses different colors to signify his corruption by the dark magic.

I think the evil of King Magnifico was meant to come later, as he was initially a good person who did everything for the best of his citizens. The song ""This is the Thanks I Get"" reflects the general discontent he feels. It's strange that the song begins with someone asking, ""What if I don't want the wish after I get the reward for bringing you this new creature?"" In my opinion, this might have been a tipping point. King Magnifico had to deny wishes, and people likely complained about that. People often show disrespect for authority, particularly Americans, who dislike being told what to do. This attitude might have been reflected in his citizens.



Some of his citizens may have been ornery and disrespectful. While many loved King Magnifico because he was a good king, others, like Aisha's grandfather, were angry when they couldn't get their wishes. I think the song from the king comes from the feeling of: ""I gave you something you wanted, and you're unhappy with the reward I gave you?""



When I watched the lyric video of the song, it was clear that something was taking over King Magnifico. Around the time he encountered the book, the video showcased two colors: green and yellow. Green seemed to represent the evil influence of the book corrupting him, while yellow represented his true, good intentions. The mixture of the two colors suggests a struggle between his original personality and the corrupting influence.

I don't think he became evil purely due to his own personality, I think it's because he was messing with the dark magic, and whatever spirit was in the book began to change him for his power.

Regarding the lyrics from the song which say, ""I let you live here for free and I don't even charge you rent,"" these lines might be redundant. However, they can be interpreted to mean he doesn't impose taxes or rents, providing free housing and possibly tax-free living, which contrasts with the typical American system where such services are not free.

Overall, King Magnifico starts as a good king who becomes corrupted over time, possibly due to the pressures and ingratitude of his people. This transformation makes him a more complex character, reflecting how external influences can change even the best intentions.

The ""I let you live here for free,"" can also mean he doesn't charge you to become a legal citizen.

In America, you have to pay to live here. You have to pay [money. To become a citizen](https://www.uscis.gov/forms/filing-fees/uscis-immigrant-fee) and start the process. This contrasts with the part of the song where King Magnifico says, ""I let you live here for free."" This likely also means he allows people to live in his country without charging them any fees.

Unlike in America, where you must pay for everything, including a green card, King Magnifico's country offers free housing, no taxes, and free citizenship. In America, you can't get necessities like food, water, heating, or healthcare for free. Many countries in Europe and Canada offer free healthcare, but America does not. The costs of living in America can be very high, making it difficult for people to survive without being charged substantial amounts of money.

King Magnifico seems to offer a more generous approach, allowing people to enter and live in his country without financial barriers. I'm sure that He ensures that newcomers are checked for safety but does not require them to pay to become legal citizens, unlike in America.

I can see why it would be done. King Magnifico was smart and had a lot of powerful magic that he used to build his country. If he needed to do something that cost money, he could make it happen without any actual cost. He could reach back into the wish bubble room and pick a wish to fix the problem.

He could make money poof out of thin air, and thus, he wouldn't need their taxes.",1716994458.0,POSITIVE,0.9778559803962708

4755,4755,Disney,"Mulán, el Soldado de más Nieves","""La flor que florece en la adversidad, es la más rara y hermosa de todas"".

Una de mis películas favoritas es sin duda Mulán, película que a pesar der ser ""para niños"", lleva en su trama valores que en lo personal trato de reflejar, y que pienso son necesarios, sobre todo, en el mundo actual. 

Piensen por un momento en; existe una guerra y uno de sus familiares, ya sea papá, abuelo, tío o amigo, ustedes ¿tomarian su lugar? ¿Perderian su vida para que ellos puedan vivirla?. No vayamos tan lejos como una guerra, quizá una operación donde deban donar su corazón, o talvez minutos antes de tener un accidente, salvar a alguien sabiendo que tú eres el que arriesgará su vida. Es lo que pasó con Mulán, sin duda tuvo gran coraje y valentía para tomar la decisión de suplir el lugar de su padre en el ejército. Sobre todo en aquel tiempo, donde realizar tal acto traía la muerte consigo. 

<<Atreverse a arriesgarse>>

""No es el hombre crítico el que importa, ni el que se fija en los tropiezos del hombre fuerte, ni en qué ocasiones el autor de los hechos podía haberlo hecho mejor.
El mérito es del hombre que está en el ruedo, con el rostro cubierto de polvo, sudor y sangre; del que lucha valientemente; del que yerra; del que fracasa una y otra vez, porque no hay intento sin error ni fallo; del que realmente se esfuerza por actuar; del que siente grandes entusiasmos, grandes devociones; del que se entrega a una causadigna; del que, en el mejor de los casos, acaba conociendo el triunfo inherente a un gran logro, y del que, en el peor de los casos, si fracasa, al menos habrá fracasado tras haberse atrevido a arriesgarse con todas sus fuerzas [... ]""

""La balada de Mulan"" es un poema narrativo chino que cuenta la legendaria historia de Hua Mulan, una joven que se disfraza de hombre para tomar el lugar de su anciano padre en el ejército. 

En la época en la que se sitúa esta historia, se consideraba inapropiado e incluso peligroso que una mujer luchará en lugar de un hombre por varias razones culturales, sociales y sobre todo legales que predominaban en China. 

La sociedad China tradicional estaba fuertemente patriarcal, con roles de género muy estrictos. Los hombres son vistos como protectores y guerreros mientras que las mujeres deberían esperar en casa, cuidar de la familia y realizar tareas domésticas. 

El honor familiar siempre fue un valor central de esta cultura, al inicio de la película observamos cómo Mulán trata de darle honor a su padre, al ir con la casamentera a que le encontrará pareja. Sin embargo como saben, sale mal. Por esa misma razón ella decide salir a luchar, pensando que así traerá honor a su familia. 

Mulan muestra una increíble determinación al tomar el lugar de su padre, aun así conociendo los riesgos y consecuencias que se avecinaban. 

A lo largo de la travesía en el ejército, sin duda ella enfrentó diferentes desafíos físicos, al iniciar su preparación para la guerra, incluso desafíos emocionales, pero a pesar de ser inicialmente menos experimentada que sus compañeros varones, no se rindió. Su perseverancia de nota en su esfuerzo para mejorar sus habilidades y demostrar su valía. 

Uno de mis momentos favoritos e icónicos es cuando logra escalar el poste utilizando las pesadas pesas, una hazaña que sus compañeros consideraban imposible, con esto, ella demostró no sólo fuerza física, sino también tenacidad y espíritu indomable. 

Identidad al descubierto, como vemos en la trama, cuando los soldados descubren su verdadera identidad se vio casi obligada a perder su vida solo por el hecho de ser mujer. Sin embargo, a pesar de ser perdonada y de tener la oportunidad de regresar a casa, no lo hace. Ella continua luchando por su país, sus compañeros y su familia. A pesar de todo decidió seguir, continuar, dejando talvez sus metas de lado como era llevar honor a la familia, lo que le importaba en ese momento era protegerlos, a ellos y a su país, mostró su fuerte compromiso sobre cualquier temor a las repercusiones personales. 

Estos valores no solo enriquecen la narrativa de Mulan, la valentía, la igualdad y la importancia de ser auténtico y leal a uno mismo y a los seres queridos, todos estos elementos clave no sólo definen su carácter sino que nos sirven como lecciones sobre el poder de la voluntad y la importancia de nunca rendirse, independientemente de las adversidades.

Putting emphasis on large hips and exaggerated hourglass figure

Super short dress

It was going to be released in Early 2024, but it gets delayed a lot and was also going to air  June 6, 2024, but was also delayed, probably due to the controversy which is the season Primos got delayed and Disney will likely shelf and cancel the series without airing or maybe sell it to some streaming service like Amazon Prime or at least maybe Disney + only by releasing all the episodes with less promotion and without a renewal for season 2, if it's the former then the Disney brand name would be removed.

My boyfriend (29M) and I travel a lot, so I asked him if he would like to do that. He said he would, because he loves amusement parks and rides, and I told him yeah but the Disney part is also quite magical, you know, the characters and all the scenarios and etc (I've been to Disneyland Paris but just for one day).  
HE TOLD ME HE NEVER WATCHED ANYTHING DISNEY. Not because he didn't want to or anything, he just never happened to watch. He knows mickey mouse obviously, but as a pop culture reference. I'm not one of those crazy Disney people at all (didn't even watch some of the movies, but watched most of it as a kid), but our generation kinda grew up watching disney suff, so I'm confused.  
I told him it's kind of a waste to go to Disneyland without knowing some of the characters and etc., and he said that we could do some marathons for him to get to know it, which is awesome. The thing is: Disney universe is...enourmous. There's also rides for things like Indiana Jones and Pirates of the Caribbean (at least in Paris), but those he knows. It's more the ""old""/""classical"" disney stuff that he doesn't have so present.  
How should I plan this? I was thinking maybe by date of release of the movies for the lion king, the princesses, etc. But about mickey, donald and etc I'm not sure what we could watch.  
I know it won't be the same as growing up watching it, but he says he would like to feel at least a bit excited as I look when I tell him about the Paris one. As I said, i'm not a crazy Disney fan, but I truly loved it when I visited (who doesn't??).  
I know that different disneylands display different things so if it helps, we would most likely be going to Disneyland Paris or, if we go crazy, to Florida (we live in Europe).",1716645747.0,POSITIVE,0.9509046673774719

I got the idea from an old disney movie I watched as a kid and my boyfriend and I had the exact description of the lady but could NOT find any pictures of her after hours of investigating. 

We both remember it's an older movie (based on our memory of the animation) it's a stout lady with a blue dress and a short black haircut. I don't think she's a main character but for some reason that high knee walk/ prance scene is pretty vivid. 

If anyone knows what I'm talking about and can remember what movie it is from, our scalps would be thanking you, because this has been quite the head scratcher for us. TIA",1716428008.0,NEGATIVE,0.9965041875839233

I’d love to reach out because its giving me hope that I haven’t been rejected and am still being looked at but it hasn’t even changed in updates on if its even been looked over…does anyone know who to address emails to regarding job follow ups with Disney?

4836,4836,Disney,I have a Question about a very detailed memory I have since I was young.,"So I can remember that I have seen an intro a long long time ago. I've seen it multiple times, and I can remember what happens in the intro but I cant remeber the name of the series, neither have I found something. Im not even 100% certain that it was a disney series, could've also been nickelodeon.

However, I just wanted to ask here as I could maybe end my long search for this lost intro. I can remember one part of the Intro very detailed.

The Intro was kind of build up on a book I think. The book was empty, then there was a Sketch, then colouring, and then animations. I remember it being outside of a school. There were builders with yellow hats constructing something, as a worm like creature came from the grund and attacked them. Then it froze for some seconds, until it went to the other page of the book which I unfortunaly dont remember.

The closest thing I have found was the intro from ""mighty ned"". From the Art style, it resembles my memorys but its not it.

1. Monsters Inc.""Door Chase"": [https://youtu.be/XJkZR6OzXIA?si=pRwIf5F5LuC813yb](https://youtu.be/XJkZR6OzXIA?si=pRwIf5F5LuC813yb) - This would be such an amazing, heart racing ride - I think the trackless could work for this or even a coaster! ... yeah definitely a coaster!
2. Luca ""Vespa Dream"" : [https://youtu.be/BxmSOTHVE8g?si=oqcEmPjOJjCTkLRm](https://youtu.be/BxmSOTHVE8g?si=oqcEmPjOJjCTkLRm) - Imagine how cool the visuals would be with this?  Not to mention the fun jumps and drops!
3. Finding Nemo ""East Australian Current"" : [https://youtu.be/U6go9eFUIIU?si=dOzdTOPkPs-PUHNt](https://youtu.be/U6go9eFUIIU?si=dOzdTOPkPs-PUHNt) - Any time spent with Crush, Squirt and the rest of the turtle crew would be great times - but rushing fast through the EAC for an extended amount of time (more than we had in the movie) would be even more fun!

Edit: This exists already in Disneyland Paris and it is called ""Crush's Coaster"" - thanks to those who pointed this  out!

1. Toy Story ""Duke Kaboom"" - No video necessary. Forget TRON - we need a Duke Kaboom stunt racer attraction! Oh Yeah!
2. Coco ""Pepita Ride"" - Much like the Vespa dream idea, this idea is built on visuals. Imagine flying on the back of Pepita through the Land of the Dead? Sign me up!

Other two questions that I have are:

Has Disney ever done a fully digital 2D animation for a film?

also the scrappy characters added to the herd like brooke and shora who were nothing but sattelitte love interest boring flat characters who where mainly added to give sid and diego mates are now in buck wild completly diseapeared and that is good.

Princess and the Frog confusing timeline,"I just rewatched this movie today, and I still do not understand how Tiana could have bought the old sugar mill when the film said she had to bring the money first thing tomorrow/Wednesday. After the Mardi Gras parade, Tiana and Navene go back to the bayou for Ray's funeral, they get married, and then they have a civil ceremony that Navene's parents attend. All of these events probably took at least a few weeks. Then, after that, Tiana brings her money to the Fenner brothers and they give her the property. How does that work out when they had another buyer who had outbid her?

I'll be honest; I do not know a lot about buying property and maybe there are some processes that I do not know about. Mayber the other buyer gave up or Charlotte and her family did something, but the movie does not show that. This might be an error on the movie's part, but I am hoping that there is an explanation that fits the current timeline of events.

4954,4954,Disney,may be an unpopular opinion but i think that hunchback would really benefit from live action treatment ,"we all know disney’s live action track record has been…something, but i think that’s simply bcs of the stories they’ve chosen. little mermaid is a fun film and has great songs but taking an animated movie which has predominately sea creatures as character’s and a main character who ends up with no voice until the final moments in the real world seems like a reach. 

the hunchback of notre dame is one of disney’s most controversial and dark stories which is exactly why i think it would benefit. it is set aside from the standard disney stereotype with themes such as religious corruption, hatred and genocide and lust and manipulation. if disney were to recruit an exceptional director, (remove that awful gargoyle song) and take a darker tone, i actually think that it would be a hit and benefit the company hugely, especially after the recent live action flops.

i believe taking the musicals approach and looking more towards to the victor hugo novel as well as disney’s own source material something truly unique could be created. i think it’s a common opinion that hunchback is alan menken’s most impressive score and the power behind the choral vocals and strength of the orchestra would translate beautifully.

the characters are some of the most well written disney has seen, specifically frollo. frollo is, in my opinion, the most frightening villain we have seen in disney. this is because he is real. there are people in the real world who are high religious figures and will abuse their power and hide behind the defence of God. most villains know they are villains and will proclaim that in their song but, unlike the rest frollo believes he is innocent, just like the lyric in bells of notre dame, clopin sings:
“he saw corruption everywhere, except within” this perfectly sums up the reality of his character. another common opinion is that hellfire is one of the best and most clever villain songs by disney. stephen schwartz’s lyrics are so incredibly well written along with the power of menken’s score and the directing of the sequence, if this was brought to live action, a truly terrifying scene could be created, highlighting issues which are still prominent in todays society, through song.

if disney were to take a victor hugo approach to their already dark adaption (for disney), i think it would sore in the box office. i know this is a controversial opinion because of disneys failure to produce live actions that fans of the originals are happy with, but i believe that this story can translate perfectly.

Monsters Inc.: I have always found this movie so boring to watch. As a kid, the only character I liked was the slug. The main characters were not interesting I'm any way/shape/form to me, and I can barely remember any of the supporting cast. I also found the villain quite boring. 

Hercules: Pegasus and the Muses were the only characters I liked in this film. Meg is probably the Disney female character I hate the most out of all the Disney items I have watched. She was a manipulative and selfish girl who imo never really showed true love for Herc. He deserved better.

The Lion King: Trauma personified. I read the book before I watched the movie, and Mufasa's death traumatized young me. Watching the movie made it even worse. I avoid all the movies in the franchise, cause 2 literally makes no sense to me.

Usually with the intent of saying ""Disney is worse than these other studios"". 

Some examples:

* ""Disney morality is Black-and-White, with clear villains and heroes""
* ""Disney relies too much on adaptations rather than original stories""
* ""Disney has too much music, whereas Studio Ghibli allows films to breathe""
* ""Disney's heroines are too passive.""

And so on...

Ghibli and Pixar are great studios with great work. But I feel like these comparisons are rather reductive because they ignore the initial context of when Disney emerged. I have longer thoughts to share but I wanted to discuss with everyone first.

4980,4980,Disney,Slept on Disney Songs,"A huge part of what makes a Disney movie become an all-time classic is its music, be it a score or a soundtrack. I wanted to list some of the songs I feel should get a little love and, in my opinion, may be a little underrated. I'll keep it to five of my favorites and leave it open for discussion. These aren't in any particular order. 

5. ""My Funny Friend and Me"" - The Emperor's New Groove

Although most of the movie, albeit very fun and entertaining, doesn't have much of a score or soundtrack, (aside from the great, ultra-talented Tom Jones being Tom Jones at the beginning)... I love this song. It gives all the feels. It's smooth. Sting did a fantastic job writing and singing it. And good lord, the choir vocals that come in. It really feels like you're being taken to church and anytime there's a choir with that level of harmonization to a song, it's usually a good recipe for a heater, which this song is in my opinion. It only appears in the end credits and it's not like Sting pulled a Phil Collins on this movie, but I give him a lot of credit for delivering and earning the check.

  
4. ""Why Should I Worry?"" - Oliver and Company

This entire movie is known by those who have seen it for its soundtrack. It's absolutely stacked with celebrity talent. Bette Midler has a groovy song, Huey Lewis writes a beautiful intro to the movie, and if that doesn't get the movie going for you, this song will. I mean, I'm not even a Billy Joel fan like that, but he absolutely killed it with this song. The whole movie has a classic '80's feel and embodies completely what the writers were going for. And being from the '80's, all these talents were in their prime. I feel like it's ""slept on"" because the movie itself is probably slept on. It came out in that time after Walt died and before Disney hit it's Renaissance period starting with The Little Mermaid in '89. The story is good, and this movie has a classic soundtrack for a Disney movie. This song is without a doubt, front and center. There's not really any song like it from any other Disney movie that I can think of, but hey, that's why I'm making this post. There could be another banger like this one out there I don't know about.

  
3. ""I'm Still Here"" - Treasure Planet

Treasure Planet has a cult following for good reason. It's really a shame that it flopped in the box office because the movie is so good. As far as male characters for boys and teens to look up to from a Disney movie, Jim Hawkins is right up there with Aladdin and Tarzan on the cool scale. The movie itself doesn't have much of a soundtrack. I think ""I'm Still Here"" is the only single. But when it makes it's appearance, it just makes the movie even better. Sometimes songs that aren't quite up to par can distract from a Disney flick's plot, but that's not the case here. It's got the lead singer of the Goo Goo Dolls, John Rzeznik writing and singing it, which is super nostalgic for a millennial and just adds to the cool factor. 

  
2.  ""He Lives In You"" - The Lion King II

I don't know how they could've possibly found a way to follow the opening to The Lion King, but somehow, someway...they did. This song, in my humblest of opinions, is damn-near equal to ""The Circle of Life"" which is a huge statement. Gives all the feels, all the chills, the song itself is a flashback to the first movie and is just beautiful. They kept all the themes of Africa from the original LK so you start off the sequel feeling right at home. Won't get into the movie itself, because I'm kinda so-so on it, mainly just because it was a huge act to follow and it went some places I felt like it should've spent less time on. No problem with the plot itself. Mainly just thought there was too much Timon and Pumba. Their comic relief was a bit overbearing to me and made it kinda distracting. But this song was perfect. Just too good.

  
1.  ""Firebird Suite"" - Fantasia 2000

I thought I'd go a less traditional route and throw a curve ball in here. Fantasia 2000 isn't a traditional Disney movie. It's a reboot of the original Fantasia from the '40's. A lot of people might not know about it or just haven't seen it. It had some mixed reviews from viewers and I've read some opinions on here reflecting the same, but pretty much the 100% consensus on here is that this was one of the best songs of Fantasia 2000. The animation is beautiful and the composition is beautiful. If you've seen it, you know the themes and if you haven't, you should give it a watch. The entire feature is only about 70 minutes and there's a few more great songs in there as well. I had it on VHS growing up and I bought it on Blu-Ray recently. I watched it and even if some might say they don't remember much of Fantasia 2000, everyone remembers the gentle, delicate, and most of all, resilient Mother Nature - the final animated song. I won't spoil it for anyone who hasn't seen it, since like I said, I'm writing this because I feel like these songs might be underrated or just not heard of because the movie isn't a household name. All I'll say is that it's the perfect choice to end the feature and it's incredibly moving for the song itself, and what the overall themes are. After I watched it again, I was putting together a couple Disney playlists - a chill one and a hype one - and came across this beautiful composition. Once it reached the end, the Finale as it's referred to when looking at the whole composition in the pieces it was ordered... it made me cry. Like a lot. A lot, a lot haha. They were those tears that come all too often in Disney where you get the combination of a moving plot and the added music which end up turbocharging all the emotions. I could talk about the experience at length, but I'll leave it to the comments.

  
I love old Disney classics. They're a part of my childhood, (28M here). Totally open for discussion if you read this and want to share some songs you think are slept on. Or if you can't think of one that is and just want to mention your favorites, I'd love to hear them too! I could talk about it all day. Thanks for getting this far if you did.

4994,4994,Disney,Toddler Unhappy with Tokyo Disney Suprise,"Hello all, just curious if this has happened to you before. I’d like to preface this by saying that my daughter is turning 5 and does get overwhelmed easily.

Today we first had a birthday party Pokemon themed with pools, water tables, cake, pizza etc and she loved it. Then my wife and I said we “forgot” about a gift. Now, I’d be thinking about this moment for months as had my wife, ready to see my daughter excited for Disney. She opened the box where there was a Minney doll, custom Mickey ears, and a custom Disney shirt. She started crying just after seeing the items saying that’s not what she wanted but then after I read the card to her saying that we’re going to Disney, she just said that’d she miss our home and did not want to go to Disney.

Needless to say my wife and I were disappointed and quickly turned off the cameras wondering what happened here. I get that she’s fine and gets overwhelmed more easily but she always is so excited about Disney, wishing she’d be able to go and now that she can, she’s upset.

My wife and I handled it well I believe, we were calm but my daughter has doubled down. I know she’ll enjoy Disney and is probably just overwhelmed right now but If I cancel this trip I’m out and easy 2-3 grand in flights, hotels, and park tickets just so far.

Can anyone recommend a travel agent who was easy to work with and who really came through on the deals, etc. ? I want this to be as magical as possible for my kiddo, but also would like to avoid spending more than I have to to make that happen…",1715257409.0,NEGATIVE,0.9802390933036804
5027,5027,Disney,Need help identifying and finding a specific Donald Duck mug.,"Hi, Reddit. A friend of mine has had this mug since they were a child, and it was recently damaged. I've been looking for a replacement of it, but have found no such mug, despite searching through many websites, using many different keywords. Does anyone recognize which company produced this mug, when it was produced and if it's one that can be purchased today?

This specific mug, as far as I know, was given to my friend in the early 2010's in Sweden.

Any help is appreciated. Thank you.

5030,5030,Disney,How would you rank the Nine Old Men in terms of importance? Who is your favorite?,"I was thinking about the Nine Old Men and their overall reputation in animation. I found that some historians would argue that ""Nine Old Men"" was a misleading title, that they weren't all equally important. And that the title created the misconception that they were ""the greatest Disney animators"". Naturally, this made me curious about ranking them in terms of their overall importance, and then discussing my favorites.

Here is my initial ranking. Subject to change.

9. John Lounsbery

8. Eric Larson

7. Les Clark

6. Woolie Reitherman

5. Marc Davis

4. Ollie Johnston

3. Frank Thomas

2. Ward Kimball

1. Milt Kahl

Having ranked them this way...I would probably say my current favorite is Frank Thomas. He and Ollie were of course the co-authors of the iconic Disney animation book *Illusion of Life.* But I feel like Frank's emotional focus and analysis really made me appreciate what *character* animation is.

Super random - I can’t believe I’m even posting this - but I was just bumping some Disney tunes for the kids (and mostly myself) 😂) as we’re doing the bedtime routine and my daughter and I had both had a record scratch moment.  “A Whole New World”, the original movie version sung by Brad Kane and Lea Salonga (1992) suddenly has new/altered lyrics.

I’ve had this album downloaded for as long as I can remember (long enough that I used to burn it onto CDs 😵‍💫) but tonight playing it, the exact same song, from the exact same album, from 1992, has subtly changed. Surely it’s updated somehow magically over Apple Music or ITunes but - but any idea why they’ve changed it up?


 To be clear this isn’t a new rendition or a live version or a remake etc., literally the exact same song, on the exact same album, but the lyrics have been dubbed differently. In fact on YouTube the original is still there - wish I could link it but Reddit isn’t going to let that happen (mods if I can, I’m happy to try again!)



Jasmine’s (Lea Salonga’s) first verse from the the original album/movie score :
“A whole new world. A dazzling place I never knew, but *when I’m way up here*, it’s crystal clear, that now I’m in a whole new world with you”

5099,5099,Disney,Doesn’t Asha becoming (Wish spoiler) defeat the purpose?,"Before I go further I want to clarify that I liked Wish. Wasn’t the best but wasn’t as bad as people made it sound. It was alright. So pls no excessive hate on it here 🥹

Anyways, at the end of the movie, Asha becomes the Fairy Godmother for the kingdom. [This user shared a theory](https://www.reddit.com/r/DisneyWish/s/pw9u57qgxK) that Asha might be the first “Fairy Godmother” in a line of them before Cinderella’s, and I think that’s a very interesting concept! And FG’s wand stemming from star magic is quite beautiful! 

So the _concept_ is really nice. But the _context_ of Asha becoming FG in the movie kindve confuses me? 

* The conflict of the entire movie starts when Asha realizes the problem of leaving so much power in one person’s hands. While she was sad her grandpa’s wish wouldn’t get granted, she was more heartbroken at how controlling Magnifico was over them in general, not even allowing ppl to have back what was originally theirs. 
* A prominent theme is that everyone is magic and their own “star”, so they don’t even need to rely on someone else to make their wishes come true. That power already lies within them. 
* Magnifico had gone mad with power and paranoia, once again signifying the big issue is all that power (control over other’s wishes) shouldn’t be left in one person’s hands. 
* In the finale after he’s defeated, many of the townsfolk realize & understand that only they can make their wishes come true. Several of them have moments directly stating how excited they are to “get started”. Peter Pan collabs with Wendy to start building a flying machine, Sabo picks up an instrument and starts playing, etc. 
* And the point of Star leaving is so the people of Rosas can continue on their own path forward. Star was never meant to stay in Rosas forever, because again, a central theme is that you don’t need someone else to grant your wishes for you, you are enough. 

But when Asha becomes FG, doesn’t that defeat the purpose? Because now she’s just taken Magnifico’s place. 

Now she has the power to grant wishes and make people’s dreams come true. Or at least she’s going to be able to once she has a better grasp on how to use magic. She takes over Magnifico’s place as the kingdom’s “sorcerer”. 

But one of the central themes was that people don’t need someone like Magnifico because having the power to control or do whatever you want with other’s people hopes & dreams was too much. 

So I’m just confused why instead of doing away with the role and the narrative rewarding Asha in a different, unique way (maybe she gets appointed as Queen Amaya’s heir, etc.), why’d they just have Asha replace Magnifico?? When the point of the movie was that his role was problematic itself? That not one person should have power over an entire kingdom’s wishes, and that ppl shouldn’t rely on someone else making their dreams come true?? 

Isn’t it a bit contradictory? ",1714823422.0,NEGATIVE,0.9939368367195129

5128,5128,Disney,Disney Gift Card Usage - Buyer Beware,"# Any ideas or contacts you may have are greatly appreciated.  

  
Disney is freezing gift cards if they have any reason to believe you have broken any of the T&C associated with the card. They also recently updated the T&C and it gives Disney full control with zero recourse by the consumer. New T&C says if obtained from an unauthorized source they can deem them unusable. However they don’t state what an authorized source is.

My recommendation is if you have gift cards use them immediately. I have found others in the same situation.

On Wed., 4/3 was finishing packing for our trip on 4/4. I am the type that purchases gift cards from Target, Costco, BJs, etc year round when the stores have deals. I then load those cards onto my Disney Gift Card Account and transfer onto one of 3 cards (Food, Incidentals, Kid Spending Money). The Food Card I have had and used since at least 2017 (oldest record I could find in my email referencing a transfer). I wanted to double check all the balances and cards were in my possession (I have other cards with no balances). I logged into my account on the night of 4/3 and to my shock 1 of the three cards (Food = large balance) was showing ""--.--"" as the balance. I panicked; immediately called the number on the back of the card. (The other two balances were fine).  
Per the 3rd party Gift Card Vendor Services all they could tell me was the card ""had been devalued and closed"" by Disney. I asked to speak to a supervisor; ""no one available"". I was instructed to send an email to gift card services with Disney and I could expect a reply within 5 days. Still panicking; I sent the email but also attempted to call any phone number I could find. I reached Guest Services and they simply transferred me to gift card services but swore the transfer wasn't to the 3rd party company - surprise surprise it was. I then spoke to Disney Store Guest Services and they at least seemed concerned and stated they would try to help with getting me a call back within an hour from a Supervisor - never happened. 24 hours later I had a return email from gift card guest services asking for some information; which I provided promptly. At this point we are at Disney starting our vacation and the bulk of our spending money I have no access too. Another 24 hours later I get a follow up response stating we are sorry but GC Services can't assist please call and or email Disney Store. I did both immediately. I spent the next 2+ hours on the phone with various Disney Store Guest Services explaining the entire situation after every transfer (missing multiple rides) trying to get this resolved. I finally spoke to a cast member who stated he needed to reach out to Asset Protection and would email within an hour with an update. Many hours later I received an email saying sorry he couldn't reach anyone for more assistance. Recommended I follow up via another phone number. I called and left a message with that number late Saturday night and have yet to get a response. We are now back home from our trip never had use of the gift card. I can't get anyone to get me to someone that can actually resolve this issue. I found an executive name and email with Asset Protection and forwarded all the information and emails and call logs to him 48 hours ago with no response. I have left numerous messages at the last phone number given that states they will respond within 24 hours and no luck.  
I of course googled this issue and have found a few references to other people currently going through the same thing and they also can't get any response from Disney and continue to get the email and call and someone will follow up.  
I have until June to get this resolved our current last planned trip with our annual passes. Thankfully we were still able to go and enjoy the trip despite not having access to the funds but I can only imagine other families might not be in the same situation.  
I stopped keeping all the transfer emails and proof of purchase for all the cards as I never imagined an issue. I highly recommend any one who does the GC thing to ensure you have proof - one post I found stated Disney asked them to prove they purchased the cards. Another post referenced that there could be a possibility that since the card was so old they actually reused the number on a newer card and the money was used by someone else??

UPDATE: they are requesting I prove all the purchases of the gift cards that I transferred onto the gift card they closed. I can come up with some proof through cards I purchased online when places like Best Buy and Costco‘s We’re having deals. But the cards I purchased at the grocery store once I transferred I trashed that grocery store receipt (because who keeps those). My recommendation if you are going to use Disney gift cards to keep every purchase not just the card in your possession. I asked them to provide me a transaction history of the cards that were transferred onto this card so I could attempt to do more research.

4/27 Update: Still no closer to a resolution. I sent them a 42 page document with screen shots of every email I could find that pertained to a Disney Gift Card. They want proof of the original gift card purchase. That card is at least 4 if not 6 years old. I asked can you tell when and where it was activated to narrow down my search of bank records and such and they stated “no”. I have also emailed every Disney execute contact info I could find for Disney Stores and Asset Protection on LinkedIn and Zoominfo with zero response. I have asked multiple times in email exchanges for someone to please call me so we can discuss over the phone and they don’t. Repeated messages to the Asset Protection phone # go unreturned.

5/1 Update: Disney is not budging and stating I need to contact the entity that I first obtained the card from but I have no way of knowing that since it’s many years old. I have asked for date and location of activation and their response is that is private data. I am furious over this. It is completely wrecking my view and feelings for Disney. I have explained over and over that I have gotten Gift Cards as gifts from family, won them in school auctions, picked them out from my employer for attendance awards and insurance company for doing my annual health surveys and such. They do not care. I have found 2 other people that have thousands of dollars frozen and one of them states they found someone that had there entire trip cancelled by Disney over their similar claims.  Those individuals have found others in the same situation. 

I I have even asked them since I know I’ve combined many cards onto that card. Can we just remove the amount in question and activate the rest but they won’t even tell me how much of the $611 is in question so instead, they’re taking it all away.

All this communication is coming from a different dept - Presidential Guest Services as Asset Protection refuses to actually speak with me.
